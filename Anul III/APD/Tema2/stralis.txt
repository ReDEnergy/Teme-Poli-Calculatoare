SPECIAL 
REMARKS 


The 
workshop 
manuals 
for 
mechanical 
parts 
have 
been 
divided 
into 
Sections, 
each 
of 
which 
has 
a 
number 
and 
its 
relevant 
contents 
are 
indicated 
in 
the 
General 
Specifications. 
Each 
section 
features 
a 
main 
Unit 
(e.g. 
engine, 
gears 
etc.). 
The 
subjects 
usually 
dealt 
with 
in 
each 
section 
are: 
Technical 
data 
table, 
Driving 
torques, 
Equipment, 
Diagnostic, 
Removal 
and 
Fitting 
in 
place, 
Repair 
operations. 
Where 
possible, 
the 
same 
sequence 
of 
procedures 
has 
been 
followed 
for 
easy 
reference. 
Diagrams 
and 
symbols 
have 
been 
widely 
used 
to 
give 
a 
clearer 
and 
more 
immediate 
illustration 
of 
the 
subject 
being 
dealt 
with, 
(see 
next 
page) 
instead 
of 
giving 
descriptions 
of 
some 
operations 
or 
procedures.

Furthermore, 
within 
each 
section, 
every 
heading 
or 
sub-heading 
concerning 
the 
operations 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
is 
preceded 
by 
a 
six 
digit 
number. 
This 
number 
is 
the 
Product 
Code 
that 
is 
to 
be 
found 
in 
the 
repair 
operation 
described 
in 
the 
REPAIR

CHARTS 
and 
in 
the 
FAULT 
CODES. 
For 
quick 
reference 
the 
indication 
of 
how 
to

For each of the journals of the crankshaft, it is necessary to carry out the following operations: 
MAIN JOURNALS: 
- Determine the class of diameter of the seat in the 
crankcase. 
- Determine the class of diameter of the main journal. 
- Select the class of the bearing shells to mount. 
CRANKPINS: 
- Determine the class of diameter of the seat in the 
connecting rod. 
- Determine the class of diameter of the crankpin. 
- Select the class of the bearing shells to mount. 
DEFINING THE CLASS OF DIAMETER OF THE SEATS FOR BEARING SHELLS ON THE CRANKCASE 
On the front of the crankcase, two sets of numbers are marked in the position shown (Figure 67 at top). 
- The first set of digits (four) is the coupling number of the crankcase with its base. 
- The following seven digits, taken singly, are the class of diameter of each of the seats referred to (Figure 67 at bottom). 
- Each of these digits may be 1, 2 or 3.

Check the torsion of the connecting rod (5) by comparing 
two points (A and B) of the pin (3) on the horizontal plane 
of the axis of the connecting rod. 
Position the mount (1) of the dial gauge (2) so that this 
pre-loads by approx. 0.5 mm on the pin (3) at point A and 
zero the dial gauge (2). Shift the spindle (4) with the 
connecting rod (5) and compare any deviation on the 
opposite side B of the pin (3): the difference between A and 
B must be no greater than 0.08 mm. 
Check the bending of the connecting rod (5) by comparing 
two points C and D of the pin (3) on the vertical plane of the 
axis of the connecting rod. 
Position the verticalmount (1) of the dial gauge (2) so that this 
rests on the pin (3) at point C. 
Swing the connecting rod backwards and forwards seeking the 
highest position of the pin and in this condition zero the dial 
gauge (2). 
Shift the spindle (4) with the connecting rod (5) and repeat 
the check on the highest point on the opposite side D of the 
pin (3). The difference between point C and point D must be 
no greater than 0.08 mm.

Checking axis alignment 
Check the alignment of the axes of the connecting rods (1) 
with device 99395363 (5), proceeding as follows: 
- Fit the connecting rod (1) on the spindle of the tool 
99395363 (5) and lock it with the screw (4). 
- Set the spindle (3) on the V-prisms, resting the connecting 
rod (1) on the stop bar (2).

so as to take the piston of cylinder no.1 to 
approximately the T.D.C. in the phase of combustion. 
This condition occurs when the hole with one

The exact position of piston no.1 at the T.D.C. is obtained 
when in the above-described conditions the tool 99360612 
(1) goes through the seat (2) of the engine speed sensor into 
the hole (3) in the engine flywheel (4). 
If this is not the case, turn and adjust the engine flywheel (4) 
appropriately. 
Remove the tool 99360612 (1). 
Set the dial gauge with the magnetic base (1) with the rod 
on the roller (2) of the rocker arm that governs the injector 
of cylinder no.1 and pre-load it by 6 mm. 
With tool 99360321 (6, Figure 177), turn the crankshaft 
clockwise until the pointer of the dial gauge reaches the 
minimum value beyond which it can no longer fall. 
Reset the dial gauge. 
Turn the engine flywheel anticlockwise until the dial gauge 
gives a reading for the lift of the cam of the camshaft of 4.90 
± 0.05 mm. 
The camshaft is in step if at the cam lift values of 
4.90±0.05 mm there are the following conditions: 
1) The holemarked with a notch (5) can be seen through 
the inspection window 
2) The tool 99360612 (1) through the seat (2) of the 
engine speed sensor goes into the hole (3) in the engine 
flywheel (4).

If you do not obtain the conditions illustrated in Figure 180 
and described in points 1 and 2, proceed as follows: 
1) Loosen the screws (2) securing the gear (1) to the 
camshaft and utilize the slots (1, Figure 182) on the gear 
(2, Figure 182). 
2) Turn the engine flywheel appropriately so as to bring 
about the conditions described in points 1 and 2 
Figure 180, it being understood that the cam lift must 
not change at all. 
3) Lock the screws (2) and repeat the check as described 
above. 
4) Tighten the screws (2) to the required torque.

Phonic wheel timing 
Turn the output shaft bringing cylinder piston 1 at 
compression stage to TDC.; turn the flywheel by about 1/4 
turn in opposite direction than normal direction of rotation. 
Turn the flywheel again according to normal direction of 
rotation until the holemarked with the double notch (4) can 
be seen through the inspection hole set under the flywheel 
housing. Fit tool 99360612 (5) into the flywheel sensor seat 
(6). 
Fit tool 99360613 (2), through the timing sensor seat, on the 
tooth obtained on the phonic wheel. 
Should tool (2) fitting be difficult, slacken screws (3) and 
direct the phonic wheel (1) properly to position the tool (2) 
on the tooth. Tighten the screws (3). 
Mount the gear (2, Figure 182) with the 4 slots (1, 
Figure 182) centred with the fixing holes of the camshaft, 
locking the relevant screws to the required tightening torque. 
Check the timing of the shaft by first turning the flywheel 
clockwise to discharge the cam completely and then turn the 
flywheel anticlockwise until the dial gauge gives a reading of: 
4.90 ± 0.05 mm 
Check the timing conditions described in Figure 180.

When it is not possible to adjust advance through the slots 
(1) and the camshaft turns because integral with the gear (2); 
thus the cam lift reference value varies and it is necessary to 
proceed in the following way: 
1) Fasten the screws (2, Figure 181) and rotate the engine 
flywheel clockwise by ~1/2 turn; 
2) Turn the engine flywheel anticlockwise until the dial 
gauge gives a reading of the lift of the cam of the 
camshaft of 4.90 ± 0.05 mm 
3) Take out the screws (2, Figure 181) and remove the gear 
(2) from the camshaft.

Description 
The engine cooling system works with forced circulation 
inside closed circuit and can be connected to an additional 
heater (if any) and to the intarder intercooler. 
It consists mainly of the following components: 
- an expansion reservoir whose plug (1) incorporates two 
valves ó discharge and charge ó controlling the system 
pressure. 
- a coolant level sensor placed at the bottomof the expansion 
reservoir with two coupling points: 
D coupling point for sensor S1 6 litres 
D coupling point for sensor S2 3.7 litres 
- an engine cooling unit to dissipate the heat taken by the 
coolant from the engine through the intercooler. 
- a heat exchanger to cool down lubrication oil; 
- a water pump with centrifugal system incorporated in 
the cylinder block; 
- an electric fan consisting of a 2-speed electro-magnetic 
joint equipped with a neutral wheel shaft hub fitted with 
a metal plate moving along the axis and where the fan 
is installed. It is controlled electronically by the vehicle 
Multiplex system. 
- a 3-way thermostat controlling the coolant circulation. 
Operation 
The water pump is actuated by the crankshaft through a 
poli-V belt and sends coolant to the cylinder block, especially 
to the cylinder head (bigger quantity). When the coolant 
temperature reaches and overcomes the operating 
temperature, the thermostat is opened and from here the 
coolant flows into the radiator and is cooled down by the fan. 
The pressure inside the system depending on the 
temperature variation is controlled by the discharge and 
charge valves incorporated in the expansion reservoir filling 
plug (1). 
The discharge valve has a double function: 
- keep the systemunder light pressure in order to raise the 
coolant boiling point; 
- discharge the pressure surplus in the atmosphere as a result 
of the coolant high temperature. 
The charge valve makes it possible to transfer the coolant 
from the expansion reservoir to the radiator when a 
depression is generated inside the system as a result of the 
coolant volume reduction depending on the fall in the 
coolant temperature.

Operating 
principle 


The 
variable 
geometry 
turbocharger 
(VGT) 
consists 
of 
a 
centrifugal 
compressor 
and 
a 
turbine, 
equipped 
with 
a 
mobile 
device 
which 
adjusts 
the 
speed 
by 
changing 
the 
area 
of 
the 
passing 
section 
of 
exhaust 
gases 
to 
the 
turbine. 


Thanks 
to 
this 
solution, 
gas 
velocity 
and 
turbine 
speed 
can 
be 
high 
even 
when 
the 
engine 
is 
idling. 


If 
the 
gas 
is 
made 
to 
go 
through 
a 
narrow 
passage, 
in 
fact, 
it 
flows 
faster, 
so 
that 
the 
turbine 
rotates 
more 
quickly. 


The 
movement 
of 
the 
device, 
choking 
the 
exhaust 
gas 
flowing 
section, 
is 
carried 
out 
by 
a 
mechanism, 
activated 
by 
a 
pneumatic 
actuator. 


This 
actuator 
is 
directly 
controlled 
by 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
by 
a 
proportional 
solenoid 
valve. 


The 
device 
is 
in 
maximum 
closing 
condition 
at 
idle 
speed. 


At 
high 
engine 
operating 
speed, 
the 
electronic 
control 
system 
is 
activated 
and 
increases 
the 
passing 
section, 
in 
order 
to 
allow 
the 
in-coming 
gases 
to 
flow 
without 
increasing 
their 
speed. 


A 
toroidal 
chamber 
is 
obtained 
during 
the 
casting 
process 
in 
the 
central 
body 
for 
the 
passage 
of 
the 
coolant.

Working 
principle 


The 
actuator 
piston, 
connected 
to 
the 
drive 
rod, 
is 
controlled 
with 
the 
compressed 
air 
introduced 
through 
the 
air 
inlet 
(1) 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
actuator. 


Modulating 
the 
air 
pressure 
varies 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
piston 
and 
turbine 
control 
rod. 
As 
the 
piston 
moves, 
it 
progressively 
compresses 
the 
external 
spring 
(4) 
until 
the 
base 
of 
the 
piston 
reaches 
the 
disc 
(5) 
controlling 
the 
internal 
spring 
(6). 


On 
further 
increasing 
the 
pressure, 
the 
piston, 
via 
the 
disc 
(5), 
interferes 
with 
the 
bottom 
limit 
stop 
(10). 


Using 
two 
springs 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
vary 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
piston 
stroke 
and 
the 
pressure. 
Approximately 
85% 
of 
the 
stroke 
of 
the 
rod 
is 
opposed 
by 
the 
external 
spring 
and 
15% 
by 
the 
internal 
one. 


Solenoid 
valve 
for 
VGT 
control 


This 
N.C. 
proportional 
solenoid 
valve 
is 
located 
on 
the 
left-hand 
side 
of 
the 
crankcase 
under 
the 
turbine. 


The 
electronic 
control 
unit, 
via 
a 
PWM 
signal, 
controls 
the 
solenoid 
valve, 
governing 
the 
supply 
pressure 
of 
the 
turbine 
actuator, 
which, 
on 
changing 
its 
position, 
modifies 
the 
cross-section 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
exhaust 
gases 
onto 
the 
blades 
of 
the 
impeller 
and 
therefore 
its 
speed. 


The 
VGT 
solenoid 
valve 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
between 
pins 
A18/A31. 


The 
resistance 
of 
the 
coil 
is 
approx. 
20-30 
Ohms.

The 
injector-pump 
is 
composed 
of: 
pumping 
element, 
nozzle, 
solenoid 
valve. 


Pumping 
element 


The 
pumping 
element 
is 
operated 
by 
a 
rocker 
arm 
governed 
directly 
by 
the 
cam 
of 
the 
camshaft. 
The 
pumping 
element 
is 
able 
to 
ensure 
a 
high 
delivery 
pressure. 
The 
return 
stroke 
is 
made 
by 
means 
of 
a 
return 
spring. 


Nozzle 


Garages 
are 
authorized 
to 
perform 
fault 
diagnosis 
solely 
on 
the 
entire 
injection 
system 
and 
may 
not 
work 
inside 
the 
injector-
pump, 
which 
must 
only 
be 
replaced. 
A 
specific 
fault-diagnosis 
program, 
included 
in 
the 
control 
unit, 
is 
able 
to 
check 
the 
operation 
of 
each 
injector 
(it 
deactivates 
one 
at 
a 
time 
and 
checks 
the 
delivery 
of 
the 
other 
five). 
Fault 
diagnosis 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
errors 
of 
an 
electrical 
origin 
from 
ones 
of 
a 
mechanical/hydraulic 
origin. 
It 
indicates 
broken 
pump-injectors. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary 
to 
interpret 
all 
the 
control 
unit 
error 
messages 
correctly. 
Any 
defects 
in 
the 
injectors 
are 
to 
be 
resolved 
by 
replacing 
them. 


Solenoid 
valve 


The 
solenoid, 
which 
is 
energized 
at 
each 
active 
phase 
of 
the 
cycle, 
via 
a 
signal 
from 
the 
control 
unit, 
controls 
a 
slide 
valve 
that 
shuts 
off 
the 
pumping 
element 
delivery 
pipe. 
When 
the 
solenoid 
is 
not 
energized, 
the 
valve 
is 
open, 
the 
fuel 
is 
pumped 
but 
it 
flows 
back 
into 
the 
return 
pipe 
with 
the 
normal 
transfer 
pressure 
of 
approximately 
5 
bars. 
When 
the 
solenoid 
is 
energized, 
the 
valve 
shuts 
and 
the 
fuel, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
flow 
back 
into 
the 
return 
pipe, 
is 
pumped 
into 
the 
nozzle 
at 
high 
pressure, 
causing 
the 
needle 
to 
lift. 
The 
amount 
of 
fuel 
injected 
depends 
on 
the 
length 
of 
time 
the 
slide 
valve 
is 
closed 
and 
therefore 
on 
the 
time 
for 
which 
the 
solenoid 
is 
energized. 
The 
solenoid 
valve 
is 
joined 
to 
the 
injector 
body 
and 
cannot 
be 
removed. 
On 
the 
top 
there 
are 
two 
screws 
securing 
the 
electrical 
wiring 
from 
the 
control 
unit. 
To 
ensure 
signal 
transmission, 
tighten 
the 
screws 
with 
a 
torque 
wrench

to 
be

For each of the journals of the crankshaft, it is necessary to carry out the following operations: 
MAIN JOURNALS: 
- Determine the class of diameter of the seat in the 
crankcase. 
- Determine the class of diameter of the main journal. 
- Select the class of the bearing shells to mount. 
CRANKPINS: 
- Determine the class of diameter of the seat in the 
connecting rod. 
- Determine the class of diameter of the crankpin. 
- Select the class of the bearing shells to mount. 
DEFINING THE CLASS OF DIAMETER OF THE SEATS FOR BEARING SHELLS ON THE CRANKCASE 
On the front of the crankcase, two sets of numbers are marked in the position shown (Figure 71 at top). 
- The first set of digits (four) is the coupling number of the crankcase with its base. 
- The following seven digits, taken singly, are the class of diameter of each of the seats referred to (Figure 71 at bottom). 
- Each of these digits may be 1, 2 or 3.

The bushing (2) is removed and fitted with a suitable drift (1). 
When driving it in,make absolutely sure that the holes for the 
oil to pass through in the bushing and small end coincide. 
Using a boring machine, rebore the bushing so as to obtain 
a diameter of 50.019 ó 50.035. 
Checking connecting rods

Checking axis alignment 
Check the alignment of the axes of the connecting rods (1) 
with device 99395363 (5), proceeding as follows: 
Fit the connecting rod (1) on the spindle of the tool 99395363 
(5) and lock it with the screw (4). 
Set the spindle (3) on the V-prisms, resting the connecting rod 
(1) on the stop bar (2). 
Check the torsion of the connecting rod (5) by comparing 
two points (A and B) of the pin (3) on the horizontal plane 
of the axis of the connecting rod. 
Position the mount (1) of the dial gauge (2) so that this 
pre-loads by approx. 0.5 mm on the pin (3) at point A and 
zero the dial gauge (2). Shift the spindle (4) with the 
connecting rod (5) and compare any deviation on the 
opposite side B of the pin (3): the difference between A and 
B must be no greater than 0.08 mm.

Check the bending of the connecting rod (5) by comparing 
two points C and D of the pin (3) on the vertical plane of the

Position the vertical mount (1) of the dial gauge (2) so that 
this rests on the pin (3) at point C. 
Swing the connecting rod backwards and forwards seeking 
the highest position of the pin and in this condition zero the 
dial gauge (2). 
Shift the spindle (4) with the connecting rod (5) and repeat 
the check on the highest point on the opposite side D of the

be carried out by fixing the tools, with the bracket A, to the 
cylinder head. 
Checking clearance between valve-stem and 
associated valve guide 
Using a dial gauge with a magnetic base, check the clearance 
between the valve stem and the associated guide. If the 
clearance is too great, change the valve and, if necessary, the 
valve guide. 
The valve guides are removed with the drift 99360481. 
They are fitted with the drift 99360481 equipped with part 
99360295. 
Part 99360295 determines the exact position of assembly of 
the valve guides in the cylinder head. If they are not available, 
you need to drive the valve guides into the cylinder head so 
they protrude by 30.8-31.2 mm. 
After driving in the valve guides, rebore their holes with the 
smoother 99390311.

The exact position of piston no.1 at the T.D.C. is obtained 
when in the above-described conditions the tool 99360612 
(1) goes through the seat (2) of the engine speed sensor into 
the hole (3) in the engine flywheel (4). 
If this is not the case, turn and adjust the engine flywheel (4) 
appropriately. 
Remove the tool 99360612 (1). 
Set the dial gauge with the magnetic base (1) with the rod on 
the roller (2) of the rocker arm that governs the injector of 
cylinder no.1 and pre-load it by 6 mm. 
With tool 99360321 (7) Figure 184, turn the crankshaft 
clockwise until the pointer of the dial gauge reaches the 
minimum value beyond which it can no longer fall. 
Reset the dial gauge. 
Turn the engine flywheel anticlockwise until the dial gauge gives 
a reading for the lift of the camof the camshaft of 4.44 ±0.05mm. 
The camshaft is in step if at the cam lift values of 4.44 ±0.05 mm 
there are the following conditions: 
1) the holemarkedwith anotch (5) can be seen through the 
inspection window; 
2) the tool 99360612 (1) through the seat (2) of the engine 
speed sensor goes into the hole (3) in the engine 
flywheel (4). 
If you do not obtain the conditions illustrated in Figure 187 and 
described in points 1 and 2, proceed as follows: 
1) loosen the screws (2) securing the gear (1) to the camshaft 
and utilize the slots (see Figure 189) on the gear (1); 
2) turn the engine flywheel appropriately so as to bring about 
the conditions described in points 1 and 2 Figure 187, it 
being understood that the cam lift must not change at all; 
3) lock the screws (2) and repeat the check as described 
above. 
Tighten the screws (2) to the required torque.

When the adjustmentwith the slots (1) is not enough tomake 
up the phase difference and the camshaft turns because it 
becomes integral with the gear (2); as a result, the reference 
value of the cam lift varies, in this situation it is necessary to 
proceed as follows: 
1) lock the screws (2, Figure 188) and turn the engine 
flywheel clockwise by approx. 1/2 turn; 
2) turn the engine flywheel anticlockwise until the dial gauge 
gives a reading of the lift of the cam of the camshaft of 4.44 
±0.05 mm; 
3) take out the screws (2, Figure 188) and remove the gear 
(1) from the camshaft. 
Turn the flywheel (4) again to bring about the following 
conditions: 
- a notch (5) can be seen through the inspection window; 
- the tool 99360612 (1) inserted to the bottomof the seat 
of the engine speed sensor (2) and (3).

Phonic wheel timing 
Turn the crankshaft by taking the piston of cylinder no. 1 into 
the compression phase at T.D.C.; turn the flywheel in the 
opposite direction to the normal direction of rotation by 
approximately 1/4 of a turn. 
Again turn the flywheel in its normal direction of rotation until 
you see the hole marked with the double notch (4) through 
the inspection hole under the flywheel housing. Insert tool 
99360612 (5) into the seat of the flywheel sensor (6). 
Insert the tool 99360613 (2), via the seat of the phase sensor, 
onto the tooth obtained on the phonic wheel. 
Should inserting the tool (2) prove difficult, loosen the screws 
(3) and adjust the phonic wheel (1) appropriately so that the 
tool (2) gets positioned on the tooth correctly. Go ahead and 
tighten the screws (3). 
Mount the gear (2) Figure 189 with the 4 slots (1) centred 
with the fixing holes of the camshaft, locking the relevant 
screws to the required tightening torque. 
Check the timing of the shaft by first turning the flywheel 
clockwise to discharge the cylinder completely and then turn 
the flywheel anticlockwise until the dial gauge gives a reading 
of 44.4 ±0,05. 
Check the timing conditions described in Figure 187.

so 
that 
each 
fold 
is 
firmly 
anchored 
to 
the 
spiral 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
others. 
This 
produces 
a

such 
as 
cold 
starting 
with 
fluids 
with 
a 
high 
viscosity 
and 
peaks 
of

In 
addition, 
it 
ensures 
uniform 
distribution 
of 
the 
flow 
over 
the

complete 
the

inside closed circuit and can be connected to an additional 
heater (if any) and to the intarder intercooler. 
It consists mainly of the following components: 
- an expansion reservoir whose plug (1) incorporates two 
valves ó discharge and charge ó controlling the system 
pressure. 
- a coolant level sensor placed at the bottom of the 
expansion reservoir with two coupling points: 
D coupling point for sensor S1 6 litres 
D coupling point for sensor S2 3.7 litres 
- an engine cooling unit to dissipate the heat taken by the 
coolant from the engine through the intercooler. 
- a heat exchanger to cool down lubrication oil; 
- a water pump with centrifugal system incorporated in 
the cylinder block; 
- an electric fan consisting of a 2-speed electro-magnetic 
joint equipped with a neutral wheel shaft hub fitted with 
a metal plate moving along the axis and where the fan 
is installed. It is controlled electronically by the vehicle 
Multiplex system. 
- a 3-way thermostat controlling the coolant circulation. 
Operation 
The water pump is actuated by the crankshaft through a 
poli-V belt and sends coolant to the cylinder block, especially 
to the cylinder head (bigger quantity). When the coolant 
temperature reaches and overcomes the operating 
temperature, the thermostat is opened and from here the 
coolant flows into the radiator and is cooled down by the fan. 
The pressure inside the system depending on the 
temperature variation is controlled by the discharge and 
charge valves incorporated in the expansion reservoir filling 
plug (1). 
The discharge valve has a double function: 
- keep the systemunder light pressure in order to raise the 
coolant boiling point; 
- discharge the pressure surplus in the atmosphere as a 
result of the coolant high temperature. 
The charge valve makes it possible to transfer the coolant 
from the expansion reservoir to the radiator when a 
depression is generated inside the system as a result of the 
coolant volume reduction depending on the fall in the 
coolant temperature.

TURBOCHARGING DIAGRAM 
Turbocharger HOLSET HY55V 
Operating principle 
The variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) consists of a 
centrifugal compressor and a turbine, equipped with a 
mobile device which adjusts the speed by changing the area 
of the passing section of exhaust gases to the turbine. 
Thanks to this solution, gas velocity and turbine speed can 
be high even when the engine is idling. 
If the gas is made to go through a narrow passage, in fact, 
it flows faster, so that the turbine rotates more quickly. 
The movement of the device, choking the exhaust gas 
flowing section, is carried out by a mechanism, activated by 
a pneumatic actuator. 
This actuator is directly controlled by the electronic control 
unit by a proportional solenoid valve. 
The device is in maximum closing condition at idle speed. 
At high engine operating speed, the electronic control 
system is activated and increases the passing section, in 
order to allow the in-coming gases to flow without 
increasing their speed. 
A toroidal chamber is obtained during the casting process 
in the central body for the passage of the coolant.

Control

Working 
principle 


The 
actuator 
piston, 
connected 
to 
the 
drive 
rod, 
is 
controlled 
with 
the 
compressed 
air 
introduced 
through 
the 
air 
inlet 
(1) 
on 
the 
top 
of 
the 
actuator. 


Modulating 
the 
air 
pressure 
varies 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
piston 
and 
turbine 
control 
rod. 
As 
the 
piston 
moves, 
it 
progressively 
compresses 
the 
external 
spring 
(4) 
until 
the 
base 
of 
the 
piston 
reaches 
the 
disc 
(5) 
controlling 
the 
internal 
spring 
(6). 


On 
further 
increasing 
the 
pressure, 
the 
piston, 
via 
the 
disc 
(5), 
interferes 
with 
the 
bottom 
limit 
stop 
(10). 


Using 
two 
springs 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
vary 
the 
ratio 
between 
the 
piston 
stroke 
and 
the 
pressure. 
Approximately 
85% 
of 
the 
stroke 
of 
the 
rod 
is 
opposed 
by 
the 
external 
spring 
and 
15% 
by 
the 
internal 
one. 


Solenoid 
valve 
for 
VGT 
control 


This 
N.C. 
proportional 
solenoid 
valve 
is 
located 
on 
the 
left-hand 
side 
of 
the 
crankcase 
under 
the 
turbine. 


The 
electronic 
control 
unit, 
via 
a 
PWM 
signal, 
controls 
the 
solenoid 
valve, 
governing 
the 
supply 
pressure 
of 
the 
turbine 
actuator, 
which, 
on 
changing 
its 
position, 
modifies 
the 
cross-section 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
exhaust 
gases 
onto 
the 
blades 
of 
the 
impeller 
and 
therefore 
its 
speed. 


The 
VGT 
solenoid 
valve 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
between 
pins 
A18/A31. 


The 
resistance 
of 
the 
coil 
is 
approx. 
20-30 
Ohms.

of:

Print 
603.93.141 


Pumping 
element 


The 
pumping 
element 
is 
operated 
by 
a 
rocker 
arm 
governed 
directly 
by 
the 
cam 
of 
the 
camshaft. 
The 
pumping 
element 
is 
able 
to 
ensure 
a 
high 
delivery 
pressure. 
The 
return 
stroke 
is 
made 
by 
means 
of 
a 
return 
spring. 


Nozzle 


Garages 
are 
authorized 
to 
perform 
fault 
diagnosis 
solely 
on 
the 
entire 
injection 
system 
and 
may 
not 
work 
inside 
the 
injector-pump, 
which 
must 
only 
be 
replaced. 
A 
specific 
fault-diagnosis 
program, 
included 
in 
the 
control 
unit, 
is 
able 
to 
check 
the 
operation 
of 
each 
injector 
(it 
deactivates 
one 
at 
a 
time 
and 
checks 
the 
delivery 
of 
the 
other 
five). 
Fault 
diagnosis 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
distinguish 
errors 
of 
an 
electrical 
origin 
from 
ones 
of 
a 
mechanical/hydraulic 
origin. 
It 
indicates 
broken 
pump-injectors. 
It 
is 
therefore 
necessary 
to 
interpret 
all 
the 
control 
unit 
error 
messages 
correctly. 
Any 
defects 
in 
the 
injectors 
are 
to 
be 
resolved 
by 
replacing 
them. 


Solenoid 
valve 


The 
solenoid, 
which 
is 
energized 
at 
each 
active 
phase 
of 
the 
cycle, 
via 
a 
signal 
from 
the 
control 
unit, 
controls 
a 
slide 
valve 
that 
shuts 
off 
the 
pumping 
element 
delivery 
pipe. 
When 
the 
solenoid 
is 
not 
energized, 
the 
valve 
is 
open, 
the 
fuel 
is 
pumped 
but 
it 
flows 
back 
into 
the 
return 
pipe 
with 
the 
normal 
transfer 
pressure 
of 
approximately 
5 
bars. 
When 
the 
solenoid 
is 
energized, 
the 
valve 
shuts 
and 
the 
fuel, 
not 
being 
able 
to 
flow 
back 
into 
the 
return 
pipe, 
is 
pumped 
into 
the 
nozzle 
at 
high 
pressure, 
causing 
the 
needle 
to 
lift. 
The 
amount 
of 
fuel 
injected 
depends 
on 
the 
length 
of 
time 
the 
slide 
valve 
is 
closed 
and 
therefore 
on 
the 
time 
for 
which 
the 
solenoid 
is 
energized. 
The 
solenoid 
valve 
is 
joined 
to 
the 
injector 
body 
and 
cannot 
be 
removed. 
On 
the 
top 
there 
are 
two 
screws 
securing 
the 
electrical 
wiring 
from 
the 
control 
unit. 
To 
ensure 
signal 
transmission, 
tighten 
the 
screws 
with 
a 
torque 
wrench 
to 
atorqueof1.36ó1.92Nm 
(0.136ó0.192 
kgm).

Description 
This power take-off has one axle,moving by gears and engaging by a clutch that takes the drive from the gears of the timing system 
irrespective of the vehicleís clutch. It can be used with the vehicle either stationary or running and for continuous use it can be 
turned on/off with the engine running. 
The PTO can be in the version for direct pump connection or with a flange for a universal shaft.

On turning the control knob A onto 1, the air reaching the fitting I passes through the control valve B and from the fitting 2 supplies 
the clutch of the power take-off C, thereby making it possible for the drive to pass from the gears of the timing system to the P.T.O. 
The control knob A is in this phase locked on position 1. 
When turning off the power take-off, turning in the opposite direction, the knob locks and automatically returns onto 0. 
Disconnect the fitting (1) of the oil delivery pipe and the air 
fitting (2) of the clutch engagement control. 
Unscrew the eight fixing screws (3) and take off the power 
take-off (4).

To refit the PTO, both when replacing it and when reusing 
the previous one, it is necessary to replace the gasket. 
Until the power take-offs are provided with plates stating the 
necessary dimension to calculate the correct thickness of the 
gasket, it is necessary to fit the gaskets of 1+0.5 mmprovided 
in kit form and overlap them. 
This is to make the gears engage correctly. 
In the future the power take-offs will have a plate stating a 
dimension that, when added to the one punched on the 
flywheel cover and using a specific table, will make it possible 
to calculate the type of gasket to fit exactly.

CHECKS 


The 
checks 
to 
make 
are 
as 
follows: 


-The 
supporting 
surface 
of 
the 
driven 
disc, 
on 
the 
engine 


flywheel, 
must 
not 
be 
particularly 
worn 
or 
have 
too 


much 
scoring. 


-The 
toothing 
of 
the 
ring 
gear 
of 
the 
engine 
flywheel 
must 
be 
neither 
deteriorated 
nor 
too 
badly 
worn. 


If 
this 
is 
not 
the 
case, 
remove 
the 
engine 
flywheel 
(operation 
540850). 


In 
addition, 
check 
there 
is 
not 
even 
the 
slightest 
leakage 
of 
lubricant 
from 
the 
seal 
of 
the 
crankshaft 
rear 
cover: 
in 
which 
case, 
remove 
the 
flywheel 
as 
described 
under 
the 
relevant 
heading. 
Remove 
the 
rear 
cover 
together 
with 
the 
seal 
and 
replace 
it 
as 
described 
in 
section 
2. 


Check 
that 
the 
bearing 
or 
bushing 
supporting 
the 
gearbox 
input 
shaft 
mounted 
on 
the 
crankshaft 
is 
neither 
worn 
nor 
deteriorated, 
in 
which 
case 
it 
should 
be 
replaced. 


Check 
the 
state 
of 
the 
pressure 
plate, 
the 
supporting 
surface 
of 
the 
driven 
disc 
must 
have 
no 
deformation, 
wear 
or 
sign 
of 
overheating 
and 
its 
spring 
or 
diaphragm 
must 
be 
sound. 


Check 
the 
state 
of 
the 
driven 
disc: 


-the 
friction 
linings 
must 
not

Push the lever (1) down fully so as to cancel the disengaging 
travel with no load. 
In the above conditions, measure the distance (A) between 
the bottom of the spherical cavity of the clutch lever and the 
clutch actuator (6) fixing surface of the box (2). 
Extract the push rod (composed of parts 3, 4, 5) from the 
clutch actuator (6). 
Unscrew the plug (7) to discharge the air under pressure 
from the piston so that the spring inside the working piston 
moves forwards as far as the stop. 
Measure the distance B = distance between the front edge 
of the tapered front portion of the clutch actuator (6) and 
the fixing surface of the actuator. 
Measure the distance C = depth of the tapered front portion 
of the piston. 
Measure the length L of the push rod that has to be: 
L = A ó (B ó C) + D 
A-B-C = measurements made 
D = 33 mm, fixed value of themaximum stroke of the actuator. 
If you find a different value, loosen the nut (4) and use parts 
(3 and 5) to obtain the calculated length. 
Tighten the nut (4) to a torque of 52 Nm (5.2 kgm) and fit 
the push rod back into the actuator (6). 
Fasten the clutch actuator (6) to the front box (2), checking 
that the push rod (3) goes inside correctly and tighten the 
nuts to the required torque. 
Unscrew the plug (7) so that the internal spring of the actuator 
(6) pushes the piston forwards and tighten the plug (7) 
to the required torque. 
Hook up the electrical connector and the compressed air 
supply pipe. 
Replacing the clutch actuator 
Not having to replace the push rod (3), mount the new 
actuator as described in the above paragraph, without altering 
the distance L of the push rod (3). 
The operator cylinder is equipped with a device to 
automatically recover the clearance due to the wear 
of the clutch plate. Therefore, it must only be adjusted 
when replacing the clutch plate or the clutch 
actuator (6). 
Before connecting the air pipe, check that the clutch 
actuator (6) is correctly secured to the front box (2). 
Lubricate the indicated points (.) with TUTELA 
MR2. 
Fitting the clutch actuator 
Discharge the air under pressure fromthe actuator (6) by unscrewing 
the plug (7). 
Move the piston of the actuator (6) back, overcoming the reaction 
of the spring, as far as its stop. 
Screwthe plug (7) back on to keep the piston in the retracted 
position.

Gearbox 
ZF 
9 
S 
109 
D.D. 
is 
mechanical 
type 
with 
synchronized 
gear 
engagement, 
with 
the 
exclusion 
of 
pick 
up 
gear 
and 
reverse 
gear, 
featuring 
front 
engagement. 
It 
is 
made 
up 
of 
a 
a 
part 
featuring 
4 
forward 
gears 
with 
reverse 
gear, 
a 
pick 
up 
gear 
and 
a 
Epicyclic 
Reduction 
Gear 
Unit 
of 
planetary 
gears 
type 
on 
the 
rear 
part. 
The 
E.R.U.unit 
(Epicyclic 
Reduction 
Gear 
Unit) 
enables 
splitting 
the 
number 
of 
gears 
of 
the 
four 
speed 
gearbox, 
thus, 
nine 
forward 
gears 
are 
available, 
pickup 
gear 
included, 
that 
can 
be 
engaged 
in 
sequence 
The 
control 
is 
fitted 
with 
an 
air-operated 
îservoshiftî 
device 
to 
improve 
speed 
selection 
and 
engagement. 
The 
servoshift 
is 
a 
device 
comprising 
a 
mechanical/pneumatic 
module 
and 
a 
double-acting 
cylinder. 
The 
advantages 
of 
this 
device 
are: 


-Faster 
speed 
selection 
and 
engagement 
with 
less 
effort. 


-It 
cushions 
the 
vibrations 
of 
the 
control 
linkage, 
reducing 
noise. 


-Less 
synchronizing 
device 
stress. 


The 
device 
works 
mechanically 
if 
the 
pneumatic 
system 
breaks 
down.

The

with 
the 
gearbox. 
The 
control

is 
controlled 
by 
the 
shaft

lets 
the 
air 
under 
pressure 
go 
through 
to 
feed 
the 
cylinder

Figure 2 
ZF 16 S 151 - 16 S 181 - 16 S 221 gearboxes in versions D.D. 
(direct drive) or O.D. (Multiplied) are made up of: 
- A central box containing themain shaft, drive input shaft, 
transmission shaft and the gears for the four forward 
speeds and one reverse gear. 
- A rear box containing the Epicyclic Reduction Gear Unit 
(ERG). Its function is to double the number of forward 
speeds by using epicyclic gears with helical toothing. 
This produces a range of gears that, starting with the four 
incoming speeds,makes it possible to have eight different 
ratios at the output (four normal speeds plus four 
reduced speeds). 
- A front box containing the step-up gearing, called the 
îsplitterî, that makes it possible for each of the eight 
forward speeds and for the reverse gear to obtain an 
additional double selection. 
The îsplitterî therefore halves the stagger between two 
successive ratios and each gear is divided into a slow ratio 
(L = slow ratio) and a fast ratio (S = fast ratio). 
These gearboxes therefore have sixteen forward speeds with 
finely staggered ratios that can be engaged in succession and 
two reverse gears. 
The synchronizing devices are the single-cone type. 
Lubrication is made with a gear pump. 
The double-H speed control is fitted with an air-operated 
îservoshiftî device to improve speed selection and 
engagement. 
The servoshift is a device comprising amechanical/pneumatic 
module and a double-acting cylinder. 
The advantages of this device are: 
- Faster speed selection and engagement with less effort. 
- It cushions the vibrations of the control linkage, reducing 
noise. 
- Less synchronizing device stress. 
The device works mechanically if the pneumatic system 
breaks down.

the 
air 
reaching 
the

To remove the gearbox, proceed as follows: 
- Set the vehicle over a pit or on a lift. 
- Disconnect the battery cables to prevent any short-circuiting. 
- Disconnect the cable (11) using the connectors (.) and 
breaking the safety lead off the screw (10). 
- Disconnect the connector (7) and the pipe (8) from the 
power take-off (if applicable). 
- Disconnect the air pipes (4) and (5). 
- Free the pipes (6) from the clamps (12). 
- Undoing the fasteners (13), disconnect the tie rod (14) 
from the gearbox. 
- Loosen the screw (2) and extract the lever (3) together 
with the tie rod (1) from the gearbox after marking its 
position for reassembly. 
- Remove the fasteners (15) of the gearbox bell, accessible 
from above. 
Removal 
! 
For gearboxes with the intarder, proceed as follows: 
- Drain off the engine coolant and disconnect the 
pipes from the heat exchanger. 
- If the cross member of the chassis frame prevents 
you fromremoving the gearbox, you need 
to drain off the oil fromthe intarder; take out the 
nuts and screws fixing the heat exchanger to the 
intarder, remove the stud bolts and detach the 
heat exchanger.

Working from under the vehicle: 
- Disconnect the pipes (1) and (2), previously freed from 
the clamps. 
- Unscrew the nuts (5) and tie the clutch cylinder (6) to 
the vehicleís chassis frame appropriately. 
- Undoing the side fasteners (8), take off the cross 
member (7). 
- Place a hydraulic jack equipped with the mount 
99370629 (1, Figure 10) under the gearbox. 
- Disconnect the propeller shaft (10) by undoing the 
screws (9) and tie it to the vehicleís chassis frame appropriately 
so it will not interferewith the removal of the 
gearbox. 
- Complete removing the gearbox bell fasteners (4). 
- Afterwards, extract the gearbox from the engine by 
bringing it suitably back out of the space occupied by the 
exhaust pipe (3). Then lower the jack and take out the 
gearbox. 
Figure 11 
! 
For gearboxes with the intarder, proceed as follows: 
- Refit the heat exchanger to the intarder, 
inserting new seals; fit the stud bolts and tighten 
the fixing screw and nuts to the required torque. 
- Connect the coolant pipes to the heat 
exchanger and replenish the gearbox with the 
required amount of oil. 
- Fill the engine cooling system as described in 
Section 2 Engine. 
Carry out the operations performed for removal in 
reverse order and tighten the fixing nuts and screws 
to the required torque.

Removal 
! 
There follows a description of the operations for 
overhauling the ZF 16 S 151 gearbox that, unless 
stated otherwise, hold for the ZF 16 S 181/221 
gearboxes too. 
Thoroughly wash the outside of the gearbox and drain the 
oil off into a container. 
! 
To dispose of the lubricant and detergents, keep to 
the specific regulations. 
Fit the supporting brackets 99371031 to the assembly. 
Using ropes with hooks and a movable lift, position the 
assembly on the rotary stand 99322205 together with the 
mount 99322225. 
! 
Use the specific tools for overhauling. 
During removal, it is advisable to put the parts down 
in the working sequence made in order to make 
reassembly easier. 
61226 
Note down the assembly position of the pipes (3 and 4) and 
disconnect them from the gearbox (5) by unscrewing the 
fittings (2 and 6) together with the washers. 
Unscrew the fixing screws (1) and remove the gearbox (5) 
together with the servoshift from the gearbox. 
! 
The servoshift cannot be overhauled. Replace it if 
you find any trouble. 
Refitting 
For refitting, carry out the steps described for removal in 
reverse order, fitting new seals and tightening the fixing 
screws (1) and fittings (2 and 6) to the required torque. 
61227 
Unscrew the fitting (2) and disconnect the air pipe (3) from 
the distributor (4). 
61257 
Unscrew the screws (1, Figure 13) and disconnect the 
servoshift (1) from the gearbox (2). 
Take out the push rod (3) with the spring (4). 
61228 
Mark the assembly position of the lever (7) on the rod (6). 
Loosen the nut (5) and remove the lever (7) from the rod 
(6). 
Extract the cup (8). 
Remove: 
- The valve (3) after taking out the screws (4).

gear unit are air operated and controlled with the speed 
control lever. 
The selector (1) pre-selects the L range (slow) and V range 
(fast) via the double control valve (6). They are inserted via 
the inhibitor valve (2) when the clutch pedal is pressed. 
The epicyclic unit engages and disengages automatically when 
passing from the 1st H to the 2nd H and vice versa. 
When the gearbox is in neutral, the driving cylinder (7) is 
operated by the pressurized air via the control valve (10). 
The vehicleís pneumatic system supplies the services 
reservoir (4) and the distributor (11) through the pressure 
reduction unit (3). 
Through the piping (13), the distributor (11) supplies the 
servo-clutch (5) that, if operated with the clutch pedal, 
supplies the servoshift (12) through the piping (14). 
A switch (9) on the gearbox control turns on the reversing 
light when reverse gear is engaged. 
The switch (8) signalling when the gearbox is in neutral is on 
the cover of the gear control. 
Another switch on the ERG driving cylinder (7) turns on the

DESCRIPTION 
The EuroTronic gearbox 12 AS 2301 D.D./O.D. is mechanical with electro-pneumatic control. 
The driver can choose whether to program gear selection/engagement manually or automatically. The shafts and gears have 
helical toothing that reduces operating noise. 
The main shaft gear coupling is obtained with sleeves with front toothing. 
The splitter and epicyclic reduction gear unit engagement is synchronized. 
The speeds are selected with finely staggered ratios and can be engaged in succession with the coupling of the epicyclic reduction 
gear unit îERGî and the îSplitterî slow or fast speed unit. 
On engaging the îERGî, the speeds of the main shaft are doubled. The ratios obtained in this way are further doubled with the 
engagement of the îSplitterî. Each single ratio is thus divided into a fast or slow ratio. 
D.D. = Direct drive 
O.D. = Over Drive (Multiplied)

Checks 
The gears, synchronizer rings, coupling bodies and sliding 
couplings must show no sign of failure or excessive toothing 
wear. 
The main shaft must have no indentation, especially on the 
sliding surfaces of the gear rotation and coupling sleeves. 
The reverse idle gear shafts must have a polished surface free 
from scoring. 
The gearboxes must show no sign of cracking and the bearing 
seatsmust be neither damaged nor worn, so as to prevent the 
outer rings of the bearings from turning in their seats. 
Check the shoulder spacers are neither worn nor damaged. 
The gear coupling forksmust show no sign of cracking and the 
relevant control rods must slide freely, but without any 
appreciable play, in their guide seats. 
Check that the shoes of the drive forks are fully efficient. 
Check that the holes, grooves and lubrication pipes are not 
obstructed by grease or foreign bodies. 
Check the bearings are not worn, damaged or overheated. 
530210 OVERHAULING THE 
GEARBOX 
! 
Wash the assembly thoroughly before overhauling. 
The specific and/or general tools must be used in the 
way for which they were designed. 
To facilitate assembly, put the removed parts away on 
the specific tray in their order of removal. 
Upon assembly, the following must always be 
replaced with new parts: the gaskets and seals, spring 
pins, safety plates and springs. Nuts and screws must 
be tightened to the prescribed torque with their 
thread dry and degreased. 
Keep to the specific regulations when disposing of 
lubricant and detergents. 
530520 Gearbox actuator 
Removal 
Unscrew the ring nut (1 and 5) and disconnect the electric 
wiring (2) from the speed sensor (6 and 7). 
Detach the wiring (2) from the clips (.) securing it to the 
middle box. 
Remove the nuts (4) and detach the actuator (3) from the 
front box.

Position two calibrated blocks (2) on the middle box (4) and 
place a calibrated rule (1) on them.

The calibrated blocks and rule must be the same ones 
used in the preceding measurement. 
Using a depth gauge (3), measure the distance between the 
top end of the circlip (5) and the top side of the calibrated rule 
(1), distance B. 
The thickness S of the main shaft end float adjustment ring is 
determined by the following equation: 
S = (A - B) - 2 
For your information (see Figure 39), subtracting the thickness 
of the calibrated blocks and rule: 
- from the distance A gives the distance X corresponding 
to the distance between the end of the spider shaft (2) 
from the mating surface of the rear box (1). 
- from the distance B gives the distance Y corresponding 
to the distance between the circlip (4) and the mating 
surface of the middle box (3).

- measure the depth of the seat on the front cover (1) of 
the bearing (2, Figure 121), distance B. 
The thickness S of the adjustment ring is determined by the 
following equation: 
S = (A -B) - C 
Where: 
A-B= measurements 
C = endfloat0˜ 0.1 mm 
For example: 
A = 5.50mm 
B = 3.90mm 
C = 0˜ 0.1 mm 
S = (5.50 -3.90) - 0 ˜ 0.1=1.59 ó 1.60 mm 
Adjusting transmission shaft bearing end float 
Determine the thickness S of the transmission shaft bearing 
end float adjustment rings by proceeding in the following way: 
- turn the shafts and check that the external rings (1 -3) of 
the bearings rest with no play on the rollers of the 
bearings; 
- measure the distance between the surface of the front 
box (2) and the external rings (1 - 3); 
D external ring (1) pump side, distance A. 
D external ring (3) overrun brake side, distance B 
- measure the distance between the surface of the front 
cover (2) and the oil pump (1), distance C; 
- mount the overrun brake disc supporting ring (3) in the 
seat on the front cover (2) and measure the distance 
between this and the surface of the cover (2), distance D. 
The thickness S of the adjustment rings is determined by the 
following equation: 
D oil pump side S = A + C + F 
A - C = measurements 
F = endfloat± 0.05 
For example: 
S = 2 + 0.05 (± 0.05) = 2 ˜ 2.1 
D overrun brake side S = B + D + F 
B - C = measurements 
F = endfloat± 0.05 
For example: 
S = 1.95 + 0.15 (± 0.05) = 2.05 ˜ 2.15 
On the external rings of the bearings supporting the drive 
input and transmission shafts, mount the end float adjustment 
rings (1 - 2 and 6) of the thickness determined in the preceding 
measurements. Insert the spring (4) and the cap (3) in the 
transmission shaft (5).

DESCRIPTION 
Allison MD 3060 PR-MD 3066 PR gearboxes are automatics 
and provides six forward gears and one reverse gear through 
an hydrodynamic torque converter, two clutches, three 
brakes and three crown wheels. 
The 5th and 6th gears are overgeared up. 
The reverse gear has a ratio that is greater than the first gear 
that allows a better speed control on slopes. 
They are fitted with a power takeoff device and an integrated 
retarder for noiseless and progressive braking.

The gearbox is equipped with the power takeoff gear. (5 - 
Figure 2). 
The power takeoff can be installed on the left or on the right 
side of the converter box (7 - Figure 3; 3 - Figure 4). 
Figure 2 
61783 
Clutches are pressure-balanced on both piston sides to 
prolong the clutch life and for a more accurate control on the 
whole range of gearbox gears. 
Planetary gears always being engaged are of the helical teeth 
type to allow a more silent gearbox operation. 
The hydrodynamic torque converter, in addition to being 
mandatory for vehicle start-up, allows a gearbox operation 
without shakes reducing wear of members composing the 
vehicle kinematic chain. 
The torsional forces emitted by the engine are absorbed due 
to the clutch/damper lockup so that they are not transmitted 
to gears and the remaining parts of the transmission. The wide 
lockup operation reduces fuel consumption and improves 
braking efficiency.

Gear selection is controlled by an electronic transmission control 
system with a microcomputer. 
The closed-loop control logic employed by the electronic 
control system allows the transmission to adapt to changes in 
the load, terrain or ambient conditions and to automatically 
compensate for fluctuations in engine power output and for 
component wear.

STRALIS 
AT/AD 


GENERAL 
INFORMATION 


The 
ZF 
Intarder 
is 
an 
auxiliary 
hydrodynamic 
brake 
integrated 
with 
the 
gearbox. 
The 
braking 
effect 
is 
obtained 
via 
the 
oil 
contained 
in 
the 
retarder. 
It 
is 
operated 
by 
a 
seven-position 
lever 
mounted 
on 
the 
instrument 
panel. 
Depending 
on 
the 
position 
of 
the 
lever, 
the 
amount 
of 
oil 
necessary 
to 
obtain 
the 
required 
braking 
torque 
is 
sent 
between 
the 
rotor 
and 
stator. 
The 
rotor 
increases 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
oil 
coming 
into 
the 
retarder 
that 
is 
slowed 
down 
as 
it 
hits 
the 
stator. 
This 
causes 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
oil 
to 
increase. 
It 
is 
cooled 
via 
an 
oil/water 
heat 
exchanger 
that 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
vehicleís 
cooling 
system. 
The 
resulting 
braking 
torque 
acts 
on 
the 
kinematic 
chain 
of 
the 
vehicle, 
slowing 
it 
down. 


Figure

OPERATION 


The 
retarder 
is 
controlled 
with 
a 
7-position 
lever 
(.)located 
on 
the 
instrument 
panel 
to 
the 
right 
of 
the 
steering 
wheel. 
Next 
to 
the 
lever 
there 
is 
an 
indicator 
light 
that 
comes 
on 
when 
it 
is 
engaged. 
The 
system 
is 
equipped 
with 
the 
constant 
speed 
function 
(Bremsomat). 
With 
this 
function 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
maintain 
the 
vehicle 
speed 
when 
going 
downhill 
at 
a 
speed 
chosen 
by 
the 
driver. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
of 
the 
retarder 
automatically 
selects 
the 
necessary 
braking 
torque. 
The 
constant 
speed 
function 
is 
only 
activated 
with 
the 
lever 
on 
î0î 
after 
saving 
the 
required 
speed. 
It 
can 
be 
saved 
on 
any 
of 
the 
7 
positions 
of 
the 
lever 
by 
briefly 
pressing 
the 
button 
on 
the 
lever. 
When 
driving 
with 
the 
constant 
speed 
function, 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
decrease 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
vehicle 
with 
the 
retarder 
lever. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
lever 
is 
brought 
back 
onto 
î0î 
the 
previously 
programmed 
speed 
is 
restored. 
The 
constant 
speed 
function 
is 
turned 
off 
by 
pressing 
the 
button 
again. 
The 
oil 
contained 
in 
the 
sump 
is 
sent 
by 
the 
pump 
into 
the 
hydraulic 
circuit 
of 
the 
retarder 
passing 
through 
a 
filter 
at 
a 
pressure 
of 
12 
bars. 
The 
supply 
circuit 
is 
protected 
by 
a 
relief 
valve 
at 
14.5 
bars. 
On 
operating 
the 
lever, 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
receives 
an 
electric 
signal 
that 
it 
processes 
and 
sends 
to 
the 
solenoid 
valve 
controlling 
the 
accumulator 
and 
to 
the 
proportional 
solenoid 
valve. 
The 
accumulator 
solenoid 
valve 
switches 
over, 
lets 
pressurized 
air 
pass 
that 
acts 
on 
the 
piston 
of 
the 
hydraulic 
accumulator, 
which 
sends 
the 
oil 
to 
the 
hydraulic 
circuit, 
shortening 
the 
retarder 
response 
time. 
The 
proportional 
solenoid 
valve 
acts 
on 
the 
control 
valve, 
determining 
the 
control 
pressure. 


The 
adjustment 
valve 
is 
controlled 
by 
the 
pressure 
of 
the 
oil 
from 
the 
control 
valve. 
Depending 
on 
the 
control 
pressure 
(max. 
5.4 
bars), 
they 
let 
the 
oil 
pass 
under 
pressure 
(max. 
9.5 
bars) 
to 
supply 
the 
rotor. 


Figure342179a.Rotor-b.Stator-c.Oilflow
Therotor 
is 
connected 
to 
therear 
axlevia 
thepropeller 
shaft 
and 
the 
stator 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
chassis 
frame 
via 
the 
retarder 
box. 
The 
oil 
in 
the 
compartments 
between 
the 
rotor 
and 
stator 
is 
set 
moving 
by 
the 
blades 
of 
the 
rotor, 
creating 
a 
flow 
of 
oil 
in 
a 
closed 
circuit 
between 
the 
movable 
and 
fixed 
parts 
of 
the 
retarder. 
The 
oil, 
on 
hitting 
the 
blades 
of 
the 
stator, 
is 
slowed 
down, 
causing 
the 
rotor 
and 
therefore 
the 
vehicle 
to 
slow 
down. 
The 
decrease 
in 
speed 
of 
the 
flow 
of 
oil 
between 
the 
rotor 
and 
stator 
causes 
the 
kinetic 
energy 
to 
transform 
into 
heat 
energy. 
To 
dissipate 
the 
heat, 
the 
oil 
passes 
through 
an 
oil/water 
heat 
exchanger. 
In 
the 
exchanger, 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
oil 
is 
transferred 
to 
the 
cooling 
water 
and 
dissipated 
through 
the 
vehicleís 
cooling 
system. 
A 
temperature 
sensor 
is 
fitted 
on 
the 
water 
outlet 
pipe 
of 
the 
heat 
exchanger. 
This 
sensor 
constantly 
sends 
the 
cooling 
water 
temperature 
to 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit, 
thereby 
ensuring 
the 
maximum 
permissible 
temperature 
needed 
for 
the 
engine 
to 
work 
properly 
is 
not 
exceeded. 
If, 
for 
whatever 
reason, 
the 
temperature 
of 
the 
water 
rises 
and 
reaches 
the 
value 
set 
in 
the 
control 
unit, 
this 
will 
adjust 
the 
air 
pressure 
in 
the 
sump 
and 
decrease 
the 
braking 
torque, 
falling 
to 
the 
highest 
level 
of 
braking 
still 
permissible. 
In 
addition, 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
receives 
the 
signal 
from 
the 
ABS 
system, 
when 
it 
comes 
into 
operation, 
that 
causes 
the 
retarder 
to 
disengage 
and 
the 
signal 
of 
the 
electronic 
transmitter 
of 
the 
turns 
of 
the 
retarder 
that 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
use 
the 
constant 
speed 
function. 
Setting 
the 
lever 
onto 
î0î, 
the 
retarder 
turns 
itself 
off. 
The 
accumulator 
solenoid 
valve 
and 
the 
proportional 
solenoid 
valve 
de-energize. 
The 
control 
valve 
switches 
over, 
producing 
a 
control 
pressure 
of 
0 
bars 
so 
the 
adjustment 
valve 
and 
the 
pressure 
increase 
valve 
are 
set 
to 
discharge 
with 
just 
the 
action 
of 
the 
spring. 
The 
switchover 
valve 
switches 
over 
under 
the 
action 
of 
the 
spring, 
discharging 
the 
supply 
circuit 
into 
the 
sump. 
The 
oil 
circuit, 
via 
the 
pressure 
holding 
valve, 
takes 
on 
a 
pressure 
of 
approximately 
1.5 
bars. 
At 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
oil 
accumulator 
is 
again 
filled.

Figure 4 
Retarder engaged 
On operating the lever (2), the electronic control unit (1) receives an ON electrical signal that it processes and sends to the solenoid 
valve (12) controlling the accumulator (10) that, by energizing, lets the air from the services reservoir (11) pass at a pressure 
of 9.5 bars, which acting on the piston of the hydraulic accumulator (10) sends the oil into the circuit, shortening the retarder 
response time. 
The proportional solenoid valve (15), on energizing, acts on the valve (16), shifting the hydraulic slide valve, determining the control 
pressure in relation to the braking level. 
This pressure, acting on the adjustment valve (14), sets the inlet pipe P in communication with the outlet pipes PI - R. 
As a result, the oil from the pressure relief valve (4)will shift the hydraulic slide of the valve (8), setting the pipe RI in communication 
with the rotor/stator via the heat exchanger (9). 
The pressure holding valve (13), not being affected by the oil pressure, shuts off the oil outlet into the sump (7).

Retarder disengaged 
Setting the lever (2) in the rest position 0, the electronic control unit (1) receives no electric signal; therefore, it de-energizes both 
the solenoid valve (12) controlling the accumulator and the proportional solenoid valve (16). 
The control valve (16) switches over, thereby causing the pressure to drop to 0 bars, so the adjustment valve (14) is made to 
discharge with just the action of the springs. 
No longer being able to send the pressure P to the switchover valve (8), the spring switches over the slide valve, discharging the 
pressure of the Rotor - Stator circuit (6) into the sump (7) and thereby freeing the exchanger changeover circuit. 
Through the holding valve (13) the oil circuit between the pump and heat exchanger (9) maintains a pressure of 1.5 bars, at the 
same time the oil accumulator fills up.

road 
(at 
least 
1 
minute 
at 
a 
speed 
of 
at

At 
the 
start 
of 
the 
run, 
briefly 
press 
the 
Intarder 
once 
(level 
6) 
and 
then 
disengage 
it 
(level

In 
this 
way 
the 
gearbox 
oil 
gets 
distributed. 


-After 
the

test, 
stop 
the

and, 
if 
necessary, 
add 
oil 
until 
it

The 
oil 
level 
of 
the

has 
to 
be 
checked 
with 
the 
vehicle 
horizontal, 
the 
engine 
switched 
off 
and 
after 
the 
oil 
has 
cooled. 
Hot 
oil 
gives 


faulty 
readings 
and 
causes 
thermal 
expansion.

If 
the 
plates 
are 
missing, 
it 
will 
be 
necessary 
to 
re-balance 
the 
shaft. 
Working

Removal 
Refitting 
For refitting, carry out the operations described for removal 
in reverse order, keeping to the following instructions: 
- The self-locking nuts have to be replaced with new parts 
for each removal. 
- After thoroughly cleaning the parts, apply sealant paste 
onto the threads of the screws fixing the differential case 
and the drive shafts. 
- Tightening sequence diagram (differential case to axle 
housing) (det. A) 
1 ó 2 ó 3 ó 4 nuts; 
10 ó 9 ó 14 ó 5 ó 7 ó 11 ó 13 ó 6 ó 8 ó 12 screws. 
- Tighten the screws and nuts fixing the differential case 
to the rear axle at the required torque and in the sequence 
indicated in the diagram. 
After refitting: 
- Screw the drain plug on and restore the level of oil with 
the required quantity and grade. 
- Check there is no leakage from the air pipe of the differential 
locking device and that it engages. 
- Check that the differential locking indicator light in the 
cab works correctly; if it does not, keep to the instructions 
described in the relevant section. 
Instructions to adjust and check the operation of the transmitter 
controlling differential locking and divider engagement. 
The operation of the transmitter (two-function type) to control 
differential and divider engagement is adjusted and 
checked with the axle mounted on the vehicle and proceeding 
as described below: 
- With differential locking, screw down the transmitter to 
close the contacts and check the indicator light in the cab 
comes on. 
- The moment the indicator light in the cab comes on, 
screw down the transmitter one more turn. 
- Tighten the lock nut to lock the transmitter at a torque 
of 40 Nm (4 kgm). 
- Release the divider and differential locking engagement 
control and check that the contacts are closed (in this 
condition, the indicator light in the cab must be off).

The rear axle is the load bearing type with a single reduction. 
It is composed of a pressed sheet steel box appropriately 
strengthened. 
The differential consists of a group of hypoid gears of coarse 
pitch type. 
The pinion is supported by two tapered roller bearings (pinion 
unit) and by a third cylindrical roller bearing. 
The position of the bevel pinion, in relation to the ring bevel 
gear, is adjusted by changing the thickness of the pack of rings 
between the differential case and the bevel pinion mount. 
The gearing box is supported by two tapered roller bearings 
and can be adjusted axially with two threaded ring nuts. 
The rear axle is equipped with a differential locking device. 
The bearings of the wheel hubs are the UNIT-BEARING type 
with permanent lubrication and need no adjustment. 
The brakes are of disc type with KNORR float calipers.

ADJUSTING 
THE 
CAP 
GAP 


Adjusting 
and 
checking 
retraction 
of 
the 
caps 
can 
be 
done 
with 
two 
methods: 


1st 
METHOD 


1. 
Use 
wrench 
99355025 
(3, 
Figure 
74) 
to 
tighten 
the 
adjustment 
lock 
rings 
(4) 
of 
the 
bearings 
until 
eliminating 
the 
pinion-crown 
wheel 
clearance 
and 
end 
float. 
At 
the 
same 
time 
check 
that 
the 
crown 
wheel 
does 
not 
force 
on 
the 
pinion; 
2. 
using 
a 
suitable 
micrometer 
positioned 
diagonally 
and 
centrally 
in 
points 
(X-Y-arrows, 
Figure 
73); 
measure 
and 
note 
the 
distance 
of 
the 
caps;

2nd 
METHOD 


A. 
Diagonally 
and 
centrally 
on 
the 
outer 
machined 
seats 
of 
both 
caps 
(2, 
Figure 
74) 
position 
two 
dial 
gauges 
(1) 
with 
magnetic 
base 
as 
shown 
in 
Figure

B. 
proceed 
as 
described 
in 
point 
î1î; 
C. 
after 
eliminating 
the 
end 
float 
further 
tighten 
the 
two 
adjustment 
lock 
rings 
(4, 
Figure 
74) 
to 
obtain 
a 
retraction 
of 
the 
caps 
(2) 
of 
0.15 
to 
0.33 
mm, 
which 
corresponds 
to 
the 
sum 
of 
the 
readings 
on 
the 
dial 
gauges 
(1).

Adjust the axial clearance between the teeth of the pinion 
- crown wheel unit which must be 0.26 to 0.50 mm 
proceeding as follows: 
- stop the bevel pinion from turning using tool 99370317; 
- position the magnetic-based dial gauge (1) as illustrated; 
- using wrench 99355025 (3) slacken the adjustment lock 
ring on the crown wheel side and tighten, to the same 
extent, the adjustment lock ring (2) of the opposite side. 
The purpose of this is to leave the previously-adjusted 
cap retraction unchanged; 
- proceed as described until obtaining the specified 
clearance. 
The clearance should be checked on 4 points the same 
distance apart.

Apply a light layer of Prussian blue on the crown wheel. 
Turn the pinion and measure the impression of the contact 
of the pinion teeth on the crown wheel teeth. 
The following figures show possible contacts and how to 
correct any errors. 
Use a magnetic-based dial gauge (1) to check that the crown 
wheel (2) does not have any upper wobble above 0.20 mm. 
If it does, disassemble the differential unit and find the cause. 
Refit and repeat the adjustment operations described 
previously.

The rear axle is the load bearing type with a single reduction. 
It is composed of a pressed sheet steel box appropriately 
strengthened. 
The differential consists of a group of hypoid gears of coarse 
pitch type. 
The pinion is supported by two tapered roller bearings and by 
a third cylindrical roller bearing. 
The position of the bevel pinion, in relation to the ring bevel 
gear, is adjusted by changing the thickness of the pack of rings 
between the differential case and the bevel pinion mount. 
The gearing box is supported by two tapered roller bearings 
and can be adjusted axially with two threaded ring nuts. 
The rear axle is equipped with a differential locking device. 
The bearings of the wheel hubs are the UNIT-BEARING type 
with permanent lubrication and need no adjustment. 
The brakes are of SIMPLEX drum type.

The rear axle is of the double reduction type; the first 
reduction is provided by the bevel pinion/ring bevel gear, 
whereas the second reduction is by means of an epicycloid 
unit on the wheel hubs. 
The differential housing (with ring bevel gear) is supported by 
taper roller bearings, which can be adjusted by means of two 
threaded ring nuts. 
The bevel pinion is supported by two taper roller bearings and 
a third straight roller bearing. 
The bevel pinion can be adjusted bymeans of adjustment rings 
located between the two taper roller bearings. 
The axle is provided with a pneumatic device for differential 
locking. 
The axle shafts start from the differential and transmit drive to 
the epicycloid reduction units. 
The drum brake is of the Simplex type.

If the studs (3) need to be replaced, before fitting new studs, 
make sure that the contact surface on the head is free of slag, 
burr, blisters. 
Using punch 99374093 (2) and a press, fit the external ring on 
the external bearing (3), stopping approx. 5 mmfrom the fully 
fitted position; complete fitting operations manually, using grip 
99370007 (1). 
Complete fitting operations manually, using grip 99370007, 
then turn the hub over and carry out the same operation with 
the external ring of the internal bearing. 
Using a hydraulic press and key 99374161 (1), with the ring 
(2) positioned as shown in the drawing, fit the brown internal 
seal ring (3) on the wheel hub (4). 
After fitting, check that the studs are fully inserted on the hub 
and that the right angle error does not exceed 0.3 mm. 
If the oil collecting sump (2) needs to be replaced, before 
assembly, smear the contact surface on the hub/sump and 
hub/hub seat with LOCTITE 573 sealing compound. 
Refit the phonic wheel (1) and, on completion, make sure that 
phonic wheel is positioned perfectly in the hub seat. 
Using a 1/100ths feeler gauge, check that the right angle error 
does not exceed 0.2 mm.

DESCRIPTION 


The 
intermediate 
axle 
is 
of 
the 
full-floating, 
single-reduction 
type 
and 
consists 
of 
a 
steel 
case 
housing 
the 
inter-axle 
differential 
and 
the 
main 
differential. 
Drive 
is 
transmitted 
from 
the 
inter-axle 
differential 
to 
the 
main 
differential 
by 
means 
of 
two 
helical 
gears. 
The 
inter-axle 
differential 
consists 
of 
a 
drive 
input 
shaft 
on 
which 
the 
following 
components 
are 
splined: 
front 
bearing 
cage, 
oil 
pump, 
drive 
gear 
with 
forward 
planetary 
gear 
and 
the 
differential 
gear 
assembly. 
The 
rear 
planetary 
gear 
is 
housed 
in 
the 
axle 
housing 
and 
is 
splined 
on 
the 
drive 
output 
shaft. 
A 
sliding 
sleeve 
for 
differential 
lock 
is 
fitted 
to 
the 
rear 
planetary 
gear; 
it 
is 
controlled 
by 
an 
air 
mechanism 
through 
a 
fork. 
The 
adjustment 
of 
the 
end 
float 
of 
the 
tapered 
roller 
bearings 
is 
made 
using 
shims 
between 
the 
front 
mount 
and 
the 
gearing 
mount: 
the 
primary 
differential 
gear 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
pair 
of 
bevel 
reduction 
gears 
with 
helical 
toothing 
(pinion-ring 
gear) 
and 
a 
gear 
housing 
(planetary 
gears). 


SPECIFICATIONS 
AND 
DATA 


The 
driven 
gear 
is 
splined 
on 
the 
pinion 
and 
is 
mounted 
on 
two 
taper 
roller 
bearings. 
Adjustment 
of 
the 
bevel 
drive 
set 
is 
by 
shims 
located 
between 
the 
two 
taper 
roller 
bearings. 
In 
addition, 
the 
position 
of 
the 
bevel 
pinion 
can 
be 
adjusted 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
ring 
bevel 
gear 
by 
varying 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
pack 
of 
rings 
between 
the 
underhead 
tapered 
bearing 
and 
the 
bevel 
pinion 
mount. 
The 
gear 
cage 
supported 
on 
two 
taper 
roller 
bearings 
and 
is 
adjusted 
for 
end 
play 
by 
means 
of 
two 
adjusting 
nuts. 
The 
rear 
axle 
is 
fitted 
with 
an 
air-controlled 
differential 
lock 
device. 
Wheel 
hubs 
are 
mounted 
on 
two 
taper 
roller 
bearings 
floating 
on 
the 
sleeve 
and 
adjusted 
by 
means 
of 
a 
threaded 
nut.

Adjusting the cap gap 
Adjusting and checking retraction of the caps can be donewith 
two methods: 
1st METHOD 
1. Use wrench 99355025 (3, Figure 97) to tighten the 
adjustment lock rings (4) of the bearings until eliminating 
the pinion-crown wheel clearance and end float. At the 
same time check that the crown wheel does not force on 
the pinion; 
2. using a suitable micrometer positioned diagonally and 
centrally in points (X-Y-arrows, Figure 97); 
measure and note the distance of the caps; 
3. further tighten the two adjustment lock rings (4, 
Figure 97) to obtain a retraction of the caps (2, Figure 97), 
measured on Axis X or on axis Y as described in point î2î 
of: 0.15 to 0.33 mm which corresponds to a preload on 
the bearings of 1.7 to 3.9 Nm (0.17 to 0.39 kgm). 
2nd METHOD 
A. Diagonally and centrally on the outer machined seats of 
both caps (2, Figure 97) position two dial gauges (1) with 
magnetic base as shown in Figure 97; 
B. proceed as described in point î1î; 
C. after eliminating the end float further tighten the two 
adjustment lock rings (4) to obtain a retraction of the caps 
(2) of 0.15 to 0.33 mm, which corresponds to the sum of 
the readings on the dial gauges (1). 
Adjust the axial clearance between the teeth of the pinion - 
crown wheel unit which must be 0.25 to 0.50 mmproceeding 
as follows: 
- stop the bevel pinion from turning using tool 99370317; 
- position the magnetic-based dial gauge (1) as illustrated; 
- using wrench 99355025 (3) slacken the adjustment lock 
ring on the crown wheel side and tighten, to the same 
extent, the adjustment lock ring (2) of the opposite side. 
The purpose of this is to leave the previously-adjusted cap 
retraction unchanged; 
- proceed as described until obtaining the specified 
clearance. 
The clearance should be checked on 4 points the same 
distance apart.

DESCRIPTION 


The 
rear 
axle 
is 
the 
load-bearing 
type 
with 
a 
single 
reduction; 
it 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
box 
formed 
of 
suitably 
strengthened 
sheet 
steel. 
The 
differential 
gear 
comprises 
a 
gear 
train 
with 
hypoid 
toothing. 
The 
pinion 
is 
supported 
by 
two 
tapered 
roller 
bearings 
and 
by 
a 
third 
cylindrical 
roller 
bearing. 


CHARACTERISTICS 
AND 
DATA 


The 
position 
of 
the 
bevel 
pinion 
can 
be 
adjusted 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
ring 
bevel 
gear 
by 
varying 
the 
thickness 
of 
the 
pack 
of 
rings 
between 
the 
differential 
casing 
and 
the 
bevel 
pinion 
mount. 
The 
gear 
housing 
is 
supported 
by 
two 
tapered 
roller 
bearings 
and 
it 
is 
axially 
adjustable 
by 
two 
threaded 
ring 
nuts. 
The 
rear 
axle 
is 
equipped 
with 
an 
air-operated 
device 
for 
locking 
the 
differential. 
The 
wheels 
hubs 
are 
supported 
by 
two 
tapered 
roller 
bearings 
floating 
on 
the 
sleeve 
and 
adjustable 
with 
a 
threaded 
nut.

Figure 1 
The front axle is a steel structure with a double-T cross-section 
at the end of which the stub axles are articulated. 
The stub axle articulation is made with tapered pins integral 
with the axle body and by means of four bearings with rollers 
driven in with interference in the holes of the stub axle 
overhangs. 
The wheel hubs are supported by two tapered roller bearings, set 
right, lubricated with oil, mounted on the shank of the stub axle. 
The bearings need no adjustment; their end float is obtained 
by tightening the retaining ring nut to torque. 
The disc brake is the îKNORRî type. 
The brake calliper is fitted with: 
- an angle of 57∞ on axles 5876/4 and 5876/2 without 
parking brake; 
- an angle of 0∞ on axle 5876/5 - 5886/5with parking brake.

Position the vehicle on level ground and lock the rear wheels. 
Loosen the fixing nuts of the front wheels. Put a hydraulic jack 
fitted with mount 99370628 under the axle (34). 
Lift the vehicle at the front and rest it on two stands. Again using 
the hydraulic jack andmount 9937628, support the axle so that 
the longitudinal bars (3) and (5) are parallel with the chassis 
frame. 
Unscrew the wheel fixing nuts and, using the hydraulic trolley 
99321024, take off the wheels. 
Remove the cabin accessing platform, if needed. Take out the 
bolts (7) and detach the board mount (8). 
Disconnect the steering tie rod (9) as follows: Take out the split 
pin (22) and the nut (21) (det. A). 
Using the extractor 99347068 (23) disconnect the swivel head 
of the tie rod (19) of the lever (20). 
Disconnect: 
- The diaphragm brake cylinder air delivery pipes(28); 
- Extract the speed sensor (17) from the brake calliper 
supporting flange (18); 
- Take out the screws (30) and extract the brake lining wear 
sensor (31) (det. B); 
- Take out the fixing screws (13) and remove the bracket 
(14) anchoring the levelling valve tie rod (27); 
- Take out the screw (24) and remove the shock absorber 
(29) from the mount (16); 
- Take out the screws (15) and remove the air spring (26) 
from the mount; 
- Remove the screw (11) and disconnect the stabilizer bar 
(12) from the connecting rod (10); 
- Take out the screws (6) and disconnect the bottom rod (5) 
from the mounts (4). Repeat these operations for the top 
rod (3); 
- Repeat the above operations for the opposite side; 
- Take out the screws (25) and disconnect the transverse bar 
(1) from the mounts (2); 
- Lower the hydraulic jack and take the axle out from under 
the vehicle; 
- Take out the screws (33) and disconnect the stabilizer bar 
(32) from the axle (34) (det. C); 
- Take out the screws (35) and disconnect the mounts (36) 
from the axle (34) (det. C).

- Tighten the nuts or the screws to the required torque. 
- The self-locking nuts must not be reused. 
- Check the state of the flexible pads, and change them if 
they have deteriorated (operation 500417). 
- Using a hydraulic jack fittedwith themount 99370628, lift 
the axle so that the leaf spring mating pins go into the 
holes made on the leaf supporting surfaces on the axle. 
- Check and if necessary adjust the geometry of the front 
wheels. 
Refitting 
For refitting, carry out the steps described for 
removal in reverse order while observing the 
following: 
The connection of the swivel head shanks (2) of the 
longitudinal rods (1) to the mounts of the chassis frame and 
of the axle has to be made when there is a distanceXbetween 
the mounts (5) and structural members (6) of X = 154 mm. 
The connection of the swivel head shanks (3) of the Panhard 
bar (4) has to be made when there is a distance X between 
the mounts (5) and structural members (6) of X = 224.5 mm.

The front axle is a steel structure with a tubular cross-section 
at the end of which the wheel hubs are keyed. 
Thewheel hubs are supported by two tapered roller bearings, 
set right, lubricated with oil. 
The bearings need no adjustment; their end float is obtained 
by tightening the retaining ring nut to torque. 
The disc brake is the îKNORRî type. The brake calliper is 
mounted on the axle with an angle of 57∞.

The front axle is a steel structure with a tubular cross-section 
at the end of which the wheel hubs are keyed. 
Thewheel hubs are supported by two tapered roller bearings, 
set right, lubricated with oil. 
The bearings need no adjustment; their end float is obtained 
by tightening the retaining ring nut to torque. 
The drum brake is the ìPerrottì type.

The front axle is a steel structure with a tubular cross-section 
at the end of which the wheel hubs are keyed. 
Thewheel hubs are supported by two tapered roller bearings, 
the Unit Bearing type with permanent lubrication. 
The bearings need no adjustment; their end float is obtained 
by tightening the retaining ring nut to torque. 
The drum brake is the ìPerrottì type.

The front axle is a steel structure with a tubular cross-section 
at the end of which the stub axles are articulated. 
The stub axle articulation is made with tapered pins integral 
with the axle body and by means of four bearings with rollers 
driven in with interference in the holes of the stub axle 
overhangs. 
Thewheel hubs are supported by two tapered roller bearings, 
set right, lubricatedwith oil, mounted on the shank of the stub 
axle. 
The bearings need no adjustment; their end float is obtained 
by tightening the retaining ring nut to torque. 
The disc brake is the îKNORRî type. The brake calliper is 
mounted on the axle with an angle of 57∞.

REPAIRS 


Keep 
to 
the 
procedure 
described 
in 
the 
chapter 
AXLE 
55080/D 
as 
for 
wheel 
hub 
overhauling. 
Adjustment 
data, 
tightening 
torques 
and 
tools 
are 
the 
one 
shown 
in 
this 
chapter. 


PNEUMATICLIFTGENERALFigure3
This 
system 
enables 
the 
driver 
to 
lift 
the 
additional 
axle 
when 
the 
vehicle 
operating 
conditions 
require 
it 
and 
to 
move 
the 
load 
to 
the 
driving 
axle 
during 
pickup 
in 
condition 
of 
poor 
grip 
of 
the 
vehicle 
(assistance 
during 
pickup). 


All 
the 
above 
operations, 
however, 
are 
bound 
to 
specific 
conditions 
of 
operation 
and 
relevant 
system 
safety 
connected 
to 
it. 


Lifting, 
lowering 
and 
assistance 
during 
pickup 
are 
controlled 
from 
a 
button 
strip 
in 
the 
cabin, 
located 
on 
the 
central 
dashboard. 


Axle 
lifting 
prevents 
tire 
sliding 
on 
ground, 
during 
vehicle 
manoueuvres. 


The 
device 
for 
assistance 
during 
pickup 
allows 
to 
totally 
or 
partially 
transfer 
the 
load 
o 
the 
additional 
axle 
to 
the 
driving 
axle 
so 
that, 
in 
the 
above 
describe 
grip 
conditions 
and 
in 
compliance 
with 
local 
laws, 
friction 
on 
the 
ground 
is 
increased. 


The 
functions 
of 
lifting 
and 
aid 
in 
the 
pickup 
phase 
can 
be 
performed 
at 
speeds 
under 
30 
km/h 
with 
a 
load 
on 
the 
driving 
axle 
of 
under 
11.5 
tonnes, 
otherwise 
the 
system 
will 
automatically 
lower 
the 
added 
axle. 


In 
order 
to 
ensure 
a 
greater 
safety 
during 
straight 
running, 
rear 
axle 
steering 
starts 
when 
the 
wheels 
of 
the 
front 
axle 
have 
exceeded 
a 
steering 
angle 
of 
5∫ 
only. 


The 
transmission 
of 
steering 
power 
from 
the 
front 
axle 
to 
the 
additional 
rear 
axle 
is 
hydrostatic, 
thanks 
to 
a 
slave 
cylinder 
fitted 
on 
the 
front 
and 
to 
a 
centring 
cylinder 
fitted 
on 
the 
additional 
rear 
axle. 
A 
hydraulic 
accumulator 
stores 
and 
keeps 
the 
oil 
in 
the 
system, 
depending 
on 
the 
centring 
cylinder 
movements, 
without 
volume 
losses.

Figure 1 
The front axle is a steel structure with a tubular cross-section 
at the end of which the stub axles are articulated. 
The stub axle articulation is made with tapered pins integral 
with the axle body and by means of four bearings with rollers 
driven in with interference in the holes of the stub axle 
overhangs. 
Thewheel hubs are supported by two tapered roller bearings, 
set right, lubricatedwith oil, mounted on the shank of the stub 
axle. 
The bearings need no adjustment; their end float is obtained 
by tightening the retaining ring nut to torque. 
The drum brake is the ìPerrottì type.

Steering 
wheel

To 
ensure 
satisfactory 
road 
holding 
performance, 
low 
tyre 
wear 
and 
to 
allow 
driving 
wheels 
in 
the 
steering 
stage 
to 
return 
spontaneously 
to 
straight 
ahead 
running 
position, 
front 
wheels 
are 
given 
the 
following 
fitting 
angles: 


-camber; 
-kingpin 
angle; 
-caster; 
-toe-in. 


These 
angles, 
suitably 
calculated, 
produce 
the 
right 
balance 
of 
the 
forces 
created 
when 
the 
vehicle 
is 
moving, 
in 
different 
load 
conditions, 
which 
tend 
to 
alter 
the 
position 
of 
the 
wheels 
on 
the 
ground.

The 
camber 
(a) 
is 
the 
angle 
formed 
by 
the 
axis 
passing 
through 
the 
centre 
line 
of 
the 
wheel 
and 
the 
vertical 
to 
the 
ground 
when 
observing 
the 
vehicle 
from 
the

The

is 
positive

when 
the

the

negative 
(B)

The 
kingpin 
angle 
(ﬂ) 
is 
the 
angle 
formed 
by 
the 
axis 
passing 
through 
the 
kingpin 
and 
the 
vertical 
to 
the 
ground 
when 
observing 
the 
vehicle 
from 
the 
front. 
When 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
kingpin 
axis 
approaches 
the 
wheel 
at 
its 
point 
of 
contact 
with 
the 
ground 
(opposite 
to 
the 
camber), 
the 
angle 
is 
positive; 
it 
is 
extremely 
difficult, 
if 
not 
impossible, 
to 
have 
a 
negative 
kingpin 
angle. 
The 
camber 
(a) 
and 
kingpin 
angle 
(ﬂ) 
make 
it 
possible 
for 
the 
axes 
of 
the 
wheel 
and 
kingpin 
to 
come 
as 
close 
as 
possible 
to 
thecentreofsupport 
of 
thetyreonthe 
ground. 
This 
produces 
low 
tyre 
consumption 
and 
a 
low 
steering 
torque. 


Caster 


Figure

The 
caster 
(.) 
is 
the 
angle 
formed 
by 
the 
kingpin 
axis 
with 
the 
vertical 
to 
the 
ground 
when 
observing 
the 
vehicle 
from 
the 
side. 
If 
the 
extension 
of 
the 
kingpin 
axis 
falls 
forwards 
to 
the 
point 
where 
the 
wheel 
rests 
on 
the 
ground, 
in 
the 
direction 
of 
travel 
of 
the 
vehicle, 
the 
caster 
is 
by 
convention 
positive 
(A); 
it 
is 
negative 
(B) 
if 
it 
falls 
behind 
the 
point 
where 
the 
wheels 
rest 
on 
the 
ground, 
and 
zero 
if 
it 
is 
exactly 
vertical 
to 
the 
point 
where 
the 
wheels 
rest 
on 
the 
ground. 
This 
angle 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
keep 
the 
front 
wheels 
straight 
when 
the 
vehicle 
is 
travelling 
in 
a 
straight 
line 
and 
for 
them 
to 
return 
straight 
on 
their 
own 
after 
the 
position 
they 
take 
in 
a 
bend 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
driver 
lets 
go 
of 
the 
steering 
wheel.

Before 
moving 
on 
to 
the 
checks, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
make 
a 
preliminary 
inspection 
of 
some 
parts 
of 
the 
vehicle 
that 
may 
affect 
wheel 
geometry. 
If 
any 
trouble 
is 
found, 
it 
will 
have 
to 
be 
rectified 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
incorrect 
measurements. 
The 
checks 
to 
make 
are 
the 
following: 


-tyre 
pressure; 
-wheel 
hub 
bearing 
clearance; 
-clearance 
between 
steering 
tie-rod 
pins 
and 
levers 
on 


stub 
axles; 
-efficiency 
of 
shock 
absorbers; 
-wheel 
rims, 
which 
must 
have 
no 
buckling 
out 
of 
tolerance. 


Check 
the 
wheel

The 
checks 
and 
any 
work 
on 
the

must 
be 
done 
with 
the

with 
a

With 
the 
measuring 
units 
still 
level 
and 
the 
wheels 
perfectly 
aligned, 
using 
the 
lever 
(1), 
move 
the 
lens 
shield. 
Using 
the 
lever 
(2), 
direct 
the 
pointer 
of 
the 
light 
signal 
onto 
the 
millimetre 
scale 
of 
the 
rule 
(3) 
corresponding 
to 
the 
diameter 
of 
the 
rim. 
Repeat 
these 
steps 
on 
the 
opposite 
measuring 
unit 
and 
read 
off 
the 
value 
of 
the 
toe-ins 
given 
in 
mm 
on 
the 
millimetre 
scales. 
The 
algebraic 
sum 
of 
these 
two 
measurements 
must 
give 
the 
required 
value. 



The 
toe-in 
is 
adjusted 
with 
the 
transverse 
tie 
rod 
so 
as, 
for 
each 
wheel, 
to 
have 
a 
toe-in 
equal 
to 
half 
the 
required 
value. 


Checking 
wheel 
deviation 


The 
deviation 
is 
checked 
while 
reading 
the 
toe-in. 
The 
partial 
value 
of 
the 
toe-in 
measured 
on 
the 
rule 
(3) 
has 
to 
be 
equal 
to 
the 
value 
measured 
on 
the 
rule 
on 
the 
other 
wheel. 
If, 
however, 
there 
is 
a 
difference 
in 
these 
values, 
e.g. 
-2 
and 
+3, 
the 
total 
toe-in 
is 
+1 
and 
is 
therefore 
correct, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
indicates 
a 
deviation 
between 
the 
wheels 
(one 
wheel 
further 
forward 
than 
the 
other) 
of 
5 
lines. 
This 
number 
of 
lines 
is 
calculated 
with 
the 
algebraic 
sum 
of 
the 
values 
measured: 
+3-(-2) 
= 
5, 
or 
more 
simply 
by 
counting 
the 
lines 
between 
the 
two 
values. 
Each 
line 
corresponds 
to 
a 
deviation 
of 
2 
mm. 
When 
the 
deviation 
is 
greater 
than 
10 
lines 
(20 
mm), 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
make 
additional 
checks, 
to 
verify 
the 
state 
of 
the 
leaf 
springs 
(whether 
one 
of 
these 
has 
given 
way, 
or 
whether 
thechassis 
oraxleare 
outofshape).

The

is 
a

value 
that 
cannot 
be 
adjusted. 
Therefore, 
if 
you 
find 
the 
value 
is 
not 
as 
required, 
detach 
and 
remove 
the

to

the 
relevant 
checks 
and

if 
necessary.

SUSPENSIONS 
STRALIS 
AT/AD 


AIR 
SUSPENSION 


The 
air 
suspensions 
are 
highly 
flexible; 
they 
have 
a 
considerable 
vibration-damping 
capacity 
and, 
above 
all, 
irrespective 
of 
the 
load 
on 
the 
vehicle, 
due 
to 
the 
systemís 
self-adjustment, 
the 
îchassis 
frame 
ó 
road 
surfaceî 
distance 
stays 
constant. 
By 
simply 
pressing 
a 
push-button 
the 
air 
suspensions 
can 
change 
the 
îchassis 
frame 
ó 
road 
surfaceî 
distance 
and 
therefore 
the 
height 
of 
the 
vehicleís 
loading 
deck. 
Besides 
the 
well-known 
benefits 
provided 
by 
the 
air 
suspension, 
the 
ECAS 
system 
provides: 


-considerable 
reduction 
in 
air 
consumption; 


-ready 
response 
to 
the 
various 
adjustment 
processes; 


-simplified 
systems; 


-wide 
safety 
margins; 


-full 
system 
diagnosis. 


The 
ECAS 
(Electronically 
Controlled 
Air 
Suspension) 
system 
automatically 
controls 
the 
nominal 
level 
of 
the 
vehicleís 
air 
suspensions. 


All 
the 
above 
operations 
anyhow 
have 
the 
constraint 
of 
specific 
operating 
conditions 
and 
the 
associated 
safety 
devices 
of 
the 
systems 
connected 
to 
them. 


The 
ECAS 
electronic 
control 
unit 
automatically 
controls 
the 
level 
(distance 
off 
the 
road 
surface) 
of 
the 
chassis 
frame 
with 
the 
actual 
values 
supplied 
by 
the 
sensors, 
comparing 
them 
with 
the 
nominal 
values 
saved 
in 
memory. 


In 
the 
event 
of 
moving 
away 
or 
the 
attitude 
changing, 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
governs 
the 
electro-pneumatic 
assemblies 
with 
which 
the 
actual 
level 
is 
corrected 
compared 
to 
the 
nominal 
one 
set 
or 
saved 
previously 
by 
the 
driver. 


The 
system 
has 
a 
remote 
control 
for 
lifting/lowering 
and 
levelling 
the 
chassis 
frame 
and 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
work 
with 
the 
vehicle 
either 
stationary 
or 
moving. 


Besides 
lifting, 
lowering 
and 
self-levelling, 
the 
remote 
control 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
save 
other 
chassis 
frame 
attitude 
levels 
and 
call 
them 
up 
when 
required. 


Chassis 
frame 
lifting, 
lowering 
and 
self-levelling 
with 
remote 
control 


Lifting, 
lowering 
and 
levelling 
the 
vehicle 
before 
loading 
and 
unloading 
it 
is 
done 
with 
the 
remote 
control 
located 
next 
to 
the 
driverís 
seat. 


The 
remote 
control 
can 
be 
removed 
from 
its 
mounting 
so 
these 
manoeuvres 
can 
be 
done 
from 
the 
ground 
too. 


!
When 
unloading 
heavy 
loads 
or 
containers 
(with 
a 
crane), 
lower 
the 
chassis 
frame 
completely. 


!
Do 
not 
stop 
the 
engine 
if 
the 
indicator 
light 
(10) 
comes 
on. 
If 
the 
indicator 
light 
(9) 
comes 
on 
while 
driving, 
stop 
the 
vehicle 
and 
turn 
the 
ignition 
key 
onto 
îSTOPî; 
after 
approximately 
(7) 
seconds, 
turn 
the 
key 
onto 
MAR 
(start). 
If 
after 
approximately 
two 
seconds 
the 
indicator 
light 
(9) 
does 
not 
go 
out, 
call 
the 
Service 
Network.

level 
is 
reached. 


The 
îSTOPî 
push-button 
(4) 
stops 
any 
action 
the 
system 
is 
performing. 


!
After 
loading/unloading 
and 
before 
starting

again, 
you 
must 
bring 
the 
vehicle 
back 
into 
its

-It 
cuts 
off 
the 
flow 
of

when 
the 
pressure 
in 
the 
tanks 
falls 
under 
a 
certain 
level 
(setting) 
after 
a 
breakdown 
or 
due 
to 
excessive 
drawing; 
-It 
supplies 
these 
tanks 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
braking 
system 
reaches 
a 
value

fully 
efficiency 
for

Level 
sensor 
The 
sensor 
comprises 
a 
coil, 
secured 
on 
the 
chassis 
frame, 
in 
which 
a 
piston 
moves 
that 
is 
connected 
via 
a 
cam 
to 
the 
lever, 
Figure 
40 
which 
is 
anchored 
to 
the 
vehicle 
axle. 
With 
a 
change 
in 
height 
between 
the 
chassis 
frame 
and 
vehicle 
axis, 
the 
lever 
turns, 
moving 
the 
piston 
that 
accordingly 
changes 
the 
inductance 
of 
the 
coil 
wired 
to 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit. 


73807 


The 
level 
sensor 
constantly 
informs 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
on 
the 
change 
in 
attitude 
of 
the 
chassis

with 
the 
road

Electro-Pneumatic Control Valve 
The electro-pneumatic control valve comprises a set of 
electromagnetic valves whose concentration reduces both 
the volume of the structure and the use of connections. 
The solenoid valves are controlled directly by the electronic 
control unit and make it possible to increase, decrease or 
hold the volume of air in the pneumatic cells.

Removal 
! 
If the screw (21) is fittedwith its head on the outer 
side of the vehicle, it will first be necessary to remove 
the side access step ó air filter assembly (detail 
B) used to help remove the front suspension. 
Proceed as described below: 
Remove the bolts (6) and (7) located inside the 
battery compartment. 
Take out the screws (24) fixing the handrail and 
the bottom (4) and top (10) screws fixing the 
handrail and the steps to the vehicle. 
Remove the access steps and the handrail. 
Disconnect the batteries and remove them from 
the battery compartment. 
Remove the bolt (5) and nuts (8). 
Take out the screw (1) fixing the air pipe. 
Disconnect the air sensor (9). 
Remove the bracket bolts (3) and loosen the air 
hose retaining strap (2) (detail A). 
Remove the air cleaner complete with its hoses. 
Remove the fastening (11) from the front mounting 
(14). 
Unscrew the four nuts (17) and extract the Ubolts 
(18). 
Disengage the shock absorber (23) front the suspension 
via the fastening (19). 
Remove the leaf spring (20). 
Park the vehicle on level ground and chock the rear wheels. 
Loosen the front wheel nuts. 
Using a hydraulic jack, raise the front of the vehicle and support 
it on two stands. 
Unscrew the wheel nuts and using hydraulic trolley 99321024, 
remove the wheels. 
Position a hydraulic jack to support the axle when the leaf 
spring is detached. 
Then, lower the hydraulic jack supporting the axle until the 
tension on the leaf spring is relieved. 
Remove the lower access step (15) as follows: 
Working from underneath the vehicle, remove the bolts (12) 
securing the U-bolts (13) to the bracket. 
At the side, remove the screw and the nut (16) with the front 
bumper and extract the access step assembly (15). 
Take out the screw (21) fixing the leaf spring (20) to the rear 
shackle (22). 
Carry out the removal operations in reverse order, 
observing the prescribed torque settings. 
Refitting 
! 
To secure the leaf spring on twoconnections to the 
chassis frame it is necessary to load it so as to 
stretch it to align the holes, using appropriate tools 
and with the opposition of the load of the vehicle 
and the hydraulic lifts.

The 
front 
wheels 
can 
be 
balanced 
on 
the 
vehicle 
using 
the 
electronic 
unit 
99305037; 
this 
has 
the 
great 
advantage 
of 
balancing 
the 
wheel 
together 
with 
the 
other 
rotating 
masses. 


The 
operation 
must 
be 
carried 
out 
as 
follows 
: 


-Raise 
the 
front 
of 
the 
vehicle 
and 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
wheels 
rotate 
freely 


-Position 
the 
imbalance 
detector 
(1) 
under 
the 
axle 
close 
to 
the 
wheel 
being 
examined, 
arranging 
the 
height 
so 
that 
the 
spin-up 
wheel 
of 
unit 
99305037 
(2) 
is 
in 
contact 
with 
the 
tyre; 
position 
a 
support 
stand 
under 
the 
opposite 
side 
of 
the 
axle 
and 
lower 
the 
hydraulic 
jack 


-Connect 
the 
cable 
(3) 
of 
the 
imbalance 
detector 
to 
unit 
99305037 


-Make 
a 
reference 
mark 
on 
the 
tyre 
by 
drawing 
a 
radial 
mark 
with 
chalk 
or 
using 
a 
strip 
of 
gummed 
paper 


-Turn 
switch 
(2) 
to 
static 
balancing 
position 
and 
sensitivity 
switch 
(4) 
to 
notch 
no. 
5 
on 
the 
graduated 
scale 


-Turn 
on 
switch 
(5) 
for 
instrument 
light 
(1) 
and 
strobe 
lamp 
switch 
(8). 


-Turn 
the 
spin-up 
switch 
(6) 
of 
unit 
99305037 
to 
the 
first 
speed 
position 
so 
as 
to 
make 
the 
wheel 
rotate. 


Turn 
up 
the 
spin 
switch 
(6) 
to 
second 
speed 
and 
place 
the 
balancing 
machine 
against 
the 
tyre. 
While 
the 
wheel 
is 
being 
spun, 
it 
will 
be 
found 
that 
the 
stroboscopic 
effect 
on 
the 
wheel 
will 
make 
the 
reference 
mark 
appear 
stationary; 
the 
pointer 
of 
the 
instrument 
(1), 
moving 
from 
the 
value 
zero, 
reaches 
a 
maximum 
value 
on 
the 
scale 
and 
then 
returns 
to 
zero. 
When 
the 
pointer 
has 
begun 
to 
fall 
back, 
withdraw 
the 
balancing 
machine, 
turn 
off 
the 
spin-up 
switch 
(6) 
completely 
and 
brake 
the 
motor 
by 
means 
of 
the 
brake 
lever 
(7). 
The 
wheel 
continues 
to 
revolve 
due 
to 
inertia 
and 
the 
reference 
mark 
made 
on 
the 
tyre 
moves; 
the 
point 
to 
which 
the 
reference 
mark 
has 
moved 
should 
therefore 
be 
noted. 
Read 
off 
from 
the 
instrument 
(1) 
the 
value 
shown 
by 
the 
pointer, 
multiply 
it 
by 
10, 
to 
obtain 
the 
value 
of 
the 
balance 
weight 
to 
be 
fitted 
to 
the 
rim.

Tyre 
pressures 
must 
be 
checked 
with 
the 
tyres 
cold. 
Carefullly 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
pressure 
is 
correct 
since, 
if 
it 
is 
higher 
than 
required, 
a 
harsh 
ride 
and 
excessive 
wear 
of 
the 
centre 
of 
the 
tread 
will 
result, 
while 
if 
it 
is 
lower, 
the 
load 
is 
not 
distributed 
over 
the 
whole 
tread 
but 
is 
concentrated 
at 
either 
side, 
causing 
premature 
wear 
of 
these 
areas 
and 
also 
damaging 
the 
internal 
structure 
of 
the 
tyre. 
Unequal 
pressures 
between 
tyres 
affects 
the 
driving 
stability 
of 
the 
vehicle 
and 
impairs 
operating 
safety. 
Abnormal 
wear 
of 
the 
tyres 
may 
appear 
in 
various 
areas 
of 
the 
tyre 
treads. 


To 
correct 
the 
residual 
imbalance, 
repeat 
the 
operations 
already 
carried 
out 
above; 
depending 
to 
the 
new 
reading 
on 
the 
instrument 
(1, 
Figure 
2), 
refer 
to 
the 
diagram 
in 
Figure

The steering control is equipped with a pneumatic device to 
adjust the angle and height of the steering wheel. 
The position of the steering wheel is adjusted by pressing the 
push-button on the floor of the cab: 
- Press the button (3) on the floor: the pressurized air of 
the services system is sent to the steering wheel 
adjustment assembly (2) releasing it. 
- Manoeuvre the steering wheel (1) into the required 
position (longitudinal travel along the axis of the steering 
column 60 mm, angular travel to the vertical 40∞). 
- Release the button on the floor.

(5, Figure 18) out of the steering wheel (3, Figure 18). Fasten 
the cover (1) of the interconnecting box (2) to the box by 
inserting the key (7) in the slots (8 and 9). This prevents the 
cover (1) and the box (2) from turning on each during 
disassembly and this condition is maintained until assembly. 
If there is no key (7), use a screw and nut of suitable length 
and diameter. 
Take hold of the interconnecting box (2), lift it carefully so 
that the retaining spring pins (3) come out of the mounting 
(4) and put it aside.

if 
the 
trouble 
involves 
the 
opposite 
travel 
as 
well. 


The 
screws 
are 
located 
on 
the 
top 
and 
bottom 
sides 
of 
the 
power 
steering 
box. 
Make 
the 
adjustment 
as 
described 
above. 


Check 


Connect 
a 
pressure 
gauge 
(minimum 
full-scale 
value 
200 
bar) 
to 
the 
pressure 
test 
fitting 
on 
the 
delivery 
line 
from 
the 
pump 
to 
the 
power 
steering 
and 
apply 
a 
steering 
force 
at 
the 
steering 
wheel 
of 
50 
± 
20 
Nm 
(corresponding 
to 
200 
± 
80Non 
a500 
mm 
diameter 
steering 
wheel), 
turning 
the 
wheel 
to 
the 
full 
lock 
position. 
The 
pressure 
reading 
should 
be 
within 
the 
range 
of 
35 
to 
70 
bar. 
If 
the 
pressure 
is 
too 
high, 
replace 
the 
adjustment 
screws 
with 
new 
ones 
and 
repeat 
the 
adjustment 
procedure. 
If 
the 
pressure 
is 
too 
low, 
check 
that 
the 
hydraulic 
system 
is 
operating 
properly 
and 
that 
there 
are 
no 
leaks.

PIPINGS 
AND 
FITTINGS 


In 
general 


Hydraulic 
system 
pipings 
for 
industrial 
vehicles 
are 
currently 
of 
two 
types: 


-Flexible 
ones 
made 
of 
polyamide 
with 
single-layered 
or 
double-layered 
structure 
and 
in 
the 
following 
diameters 
(ÿ 
6-8-10-12-16 
mm) 
equipped 
with 
spares 
in 
meters. 


-Rigid 
metal 
pipings 
in 
the 
following 
diameters 
(ÿ 
4.75-6.35-8-10-12 
mm). 
Pipings 
from 
ÿ 
4.75 
to 
ÿ 
10 
mm 
are 
supplied 
as 
spares 
in 
straight 
4-5-6 
m 
crop 
ends, 
while 
those 
exceeding 
10 
mm 
are 
supplied 
as 
spares 
already 
cut, 
bent 
and 
reflanged.

AT/AD 


EBS 
(ELECTRONIC 
BRAKE 
SYSTEM) 


The 
increase 
in 
competition 
in 
the 
transport 
sector 
has 
had 
the 
effect, 
among 
others, 
of 
constantly 
increasing 
the 
basic 
requirements 
of 
braking 
systems. 
The 
introduction 
of 
the 
EBS 
electronic 
brake 
system 
is 
the 
logical 
answer 
to 
these 
new 
needs. 
It 
is 
an 
integrated 
and 
permanent 
electronic 
control 
system 
for 
the 
brake 
system 
of 
the 
tractor 
and 
trailer. 
It 
supplements 
the 
ABS, 
ASR 
and 
EBL 
functions. 


The 
system 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
pneumatic 
system 
and 
an 
electric 
system 
containing 
the 
following 
components: 
Duplex 
control 
valve 
with 
electric 
transmitter, 
proportional 
relay 
valve 
for 
front 
axle, 
ABS 
for 
front 
axle, 
rear 
axle 
electro-pneumatic 
modulator, 
trailer 
servo 
control 
valve. 


The 
EBS 
system 
dialogues 
with 
the 
control 
units 
of 
the 
other 
assemblies: 
Engine, 
Ecas, 
retarder 
and 
gearbox 
via 
the 
CAN 
line 
(VDB, 
Vehicle 
Data 
Bus). 


EBS 
Benefits 


Lower 
servicing 
costs. 


The 
EBS 
combines 
many 
functions. 
The 
aim 
is 
to 
cut 
maintenance 
costs 
while 
maximizing 
braking 
safety 
ó 
that 
is 
minimizing 
brake 
lining 
wear. 


An 
individual 
control 
according 
to 
the 
lining 
wear 
parameters 
on 
both 
the 
front 
and 
rear 
axles 
harmonizes 
lining 
wear. 
Distributing 
the 
load 
homogeneously 
between 
all 
the 
brakes 
of 
the 
wheels 
reduces 
total 
consumption. 
In 
addition, 
the 
frequency 
of 
servicing 
and 
changing 
the 
linings 
coincide. 
The 
costs 
of 
inactivity 
are 
drastically 
reduced. 


Depending 
on 
the 
servicing 
a 
vehicle 
needs 
along 
with 
other 
factors, 
the 
owner 
may 
be 
able 
to 
make 
considerable 
savings. 
A 
comparison 
of 
the 
maintenance 
costs, 
for 
the 
brake 
system, 
of 
a 
vehicle 
with 
EBS 
and 
one 
with 
a 
conventional 
brake 
system 
highlights 
significant 
savings. 


Tractor 
and 
trailer 
compatibility 
at 
any 
time 


Harmonizing 
the 
braking 
processes 
of 
the 
entire 
tractor-trailer 
combination, 
especially 
if 
the 
combinations 
are 
frequently 
changed, 
often 
with 
conventional 
means, 
is 
not 
satisfactory. 


An 
inadequate 
balance, 
such 
as 
with 
a 
trailer 
whose 
braking 
is 
not 
sufficiently 
effective, 
will 
cause 
uneven 
wear 
of 
the 
brake 
linings. 


The 
EBS 
will 
recognize 
all 
the 
incompatibilities 
between 
tractor 
and 
trailer, 
harmonizing 
braking 
automatically. 
When 
the 
brakes 
work 
in 
the 
best 
conditions, 
not 
only 
are 
brake 
maintenance 
costs 
optimized, 
but 
safety 
and 
comfort 
are 
optimum 
too. 


Complete 
fault-diagnosis 
structures 


TheEBS 
provides 
theowner 
of 
thevehicle 
with 
constantly 
updated 
information 
on 
the 
state 
of 
the 
brake 
system 
and 
the 
basic 
brakes. 
This 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
schedule 
servicing 
in 
advance. 
The 
EBS 
monitors 
all 
the 
fundamental 
components 
and 
functions 
of 
the 
brake 
system. 


Any 
defect 
recognized 
by 
the 
system 
is 
accurately 
highlighted. 
The 
maintenance 
specialist 
can 
therefore 
rectify 
the 
error 
at 
issue. 
The 
high 
degree 
of 
safety 
ensured 
by 
the 
EBS 
is 
due 
to 
several 
factors: 
-Lower 
pressure 
accumulation 
and 
response 
times 
for 
the 
brakes 
on 
the 
front, 
rear 
and 
trailer 
axles. 
-Better 
ABS 
function. 
-Tractor/trailer 
always 
balanced 
in 
every 
moment. 
-Constant 
monitoring 
of 
the 
service 
brake 
system. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
reduced 
brake 
performance, 
the 
EBS 
will 
be 
able 
to 
warn 
the 


driver. 
-The 
integrated 
ASR 
function 
permits 
optimum 
vehicle 
stability 
and 
drive 
optimization.

The 
purpose 
of 
the

is 
to 
slow

AUXILIARY 
BRAKE 
INTEGRATION 


Commercial 
vehicles 
are 
normally 
fitted 
with 
auxiliary 
brakes 
for 
slowing 
down 
without 
causing 
wear, 
such 
as 
the 
exhaust 
brake 
and 
intarder. 


On 
vehicles 
equipped 
with 
the 
EBS, 
these 
devices 
can 
be 
integrated 
to 
ensure 
the 
vehicle 
slows 
down 
sooner 
and 
more 
effectively. 
The 
exhaust 
brake/intarder 
action 
percentage 
is 
set 
by 
the 
driver 
with 
the 
lever. 


The 
exhaust 
brake 
will 
be 
applied 
up 
to 
a 
speed 
of 
1000 
rpm, 
while 
the 
action 
of 
the 
retarder 
will 
cause 
the 
following 
action 
depending 
on 
the 
position 
of 
the 
lever:

lever 
on

slowing 
down 
will

by 
comparing

On 
the 
basis 
of 
wheel 
r.p.m.ís 
and 
braking 
pressure 
(detected 
by 
the 
sensor 
upstream 
from 
rear 
axle

modulators), 
the

calculates 
vehicle 
speed, 
rear

ìskiddingî 
and 
minimum

expected. 


ìABSî 
(Anti-Lock 
Brake 
System) 


The 
braking 
of 
a 
moving 
vehicle 
and 
the 
according 
deceleration 
and 
stopping 
distances 
depend 
above 
all 
on 
the 
grip 
between 
the 
surfaces 
of 
the 
tyres 
and 
the 
road. 


With 
a 
fully 
efficient 
braking 
system, 
a 
further 
improvement 
in 
braking 
can 
only 
be 
achieved 
by 
acting 
on 
the 
friction 
of 
the 
tyres 
or 
on 
the 
grade 
of 
the 
road 
surface. 


Even 
in 
these 
optimum 
conditions, 
absolute 
braking 
safety 
is 
anyhow 
not 
guaranteed 
when 
faced 
with 
especially 
tricky 
situations, 
such 
as 
poor 
grip 
due 
to 
a 
wet 
or 
icy 
road 
surface: 
the 
driver 
is 
forced 
to 
moderate 
use 
of 
the 
brakes 
in 
order 
to 
avoid 
partially 
locking 
one 
or 
more 
wheels, 
with 
the 
risk 
of 
skidding 
dangerously. 


The 
function 
of 
the 
îABSî 
is 
therefore 
to 
ensure 
vehicle 
stability 
(in 
all 
braking 
conditions), 
preventing 
the 
wheels 
from 
locking 
irrespective 
of 
the 
state 
of 
the 
road 
surface, 
so 
as 
to 
ensure 
the 
available 
grip 
is 
made 
full 
use 
of. 


Even 
in 
the 
case 
of 
emergency 
braking, 
the 
system 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
keep 
direction, 
that 
is 
to 
turn 
the 
steering 
wheel 
to 
avoid 
obstacles 
with 
no 
risk 
of 
skidding. 


In 
short, 
the 
anti-lock 
brake 
system 
(ABS): 


-Prevents 
the 
wheels 
locking 
when 
the 
vehicle 
is 
braking, 
no 
matter 
what 
grip 
is 
available 
on 
the 
road. 
-Shortens 
stopping 
distances. 
-Provides 
safety 
for 
the 
driver 
who 
can 
keep 
the 
vehicleís 
stability 
and 
direction.

The 
EBL 
function 
checks 
the 
rear 
axle 
wheel 
îslipî, 
comparing 
it 
with 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
wheels 
of 
the 
front 
axle. 


The 
control 
unit 
input 
data 
are 
the 
wheel 
speed 
and 
braking 
pressure 
measured 
by 
the 
pressure 
sensor 
installed 
upstream 
from 
the 
rear 
axle 
ABS 
modulators. 


On 
the 
basis 
of 
these 
values, 
the 
control 
unit 
calculates 
the 
speed 
of 
the 
vehicle, 
the 
vehicleís 
deceleration, 
the 
rear 
axle 
wheel 
îslipî 
and 
the 
minimum 
deceleration 
contemplated. 


The 
EBL 
function 
is 
activated 
(the 
rear 
ABS 
modulators 
maintain 
the 
set 
pressure) 
when 
the 
driver 
applies 
an 
excessive 
braking 
force 
for 
the 
conditions 
of 
load 
on 
the 
vehicle, 
in 
short 
when 
the 
rear 
axle 
slip 
and 
vehicle 
deceleration 
thresholds 
are 
exceeded. 


Operating 
Logic 


The 
purpose 
of 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
is 
to 
slow 
down 
the 
vehicle 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible, 
ensuring 
its 
stability 
and 
avoiding 
the 
tendency 
for 
the 
wheels 
to 
lock. 
To 
achieve 
this 
aim, 
while 
braking, 
the 
electronic 
control 
unit 
will 
be 
informed 
of 
the: 


-braking 
intensity 
required 
by 
the 
driver 
via 
the 
rear 
axle 
pressure 
sensor, 


-reaction 
on 
slowing 
down 
due 
to 
the 
pressures 
made 
available 
via 
the 
speed

signals. 


The 
continuous 
monitoring 
and 
processing 
of 
this 
information, 
in 
relation 
to 
the 
set 
aim, 
will 
cause 
the 
rear 
axle

to 
activate 
appropriately 
and 
optimize 
the 
braking 
action 
accordingly.

DESCRIPTION 
Service 
braking 


Pedal-operated, 
pneumatic, 
with 
electric 
control 
acting 
on 
all 
the 
wheels 
and 
on 
the 
trailer. 


It 
is 
composed 
of 
two 
independent 
sections, 
one 
for 
activating 
the 
braking 
elements 
of 
the 
front 
axle, 
the 
other 
for 
activating 
the 
braking 
elements 
of 
the 
rear 
axle. 


The 
division 
of 
the 
air 
system, 
if 
one 
section 
breaks 
down, 
permits 
the 
other 
to 
remain 
efficient. 


Emergency 
braking 


Emergency 
braking 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
slow 
down 
the 
vehicle 
and 
stop 
it 
within 
a 
safety 
distance, 
even 
if 
the 
braking 
system 
has 
broken 
down. 


It 
should 
be 
interpreted 
as 
a 
partial 
service 
brake 
that, 
thanks 
to 
the 
dual 
circuit, 
anyhow 
acts 
on 
one 
of 
the 
two 
axles. 


Exhaust 
brake 


The 
îexhaust 
brakeî 
function 
is 
controlled 
by 
the 
EDC 
control 
unit 
that, 
depending 
on 
the 
required 
braking 
capacity, 
governs 
this 
function 
in 
combination 
with 
the 
EBS 
and 
Intarder 
systems 
(where 
applicable). 


Parking 
brake 


This 
comprises 
the 
pneumatic 
control 
of 
the 
manual 
control 
valve, 
a 
spring 
cylinder 
acting 
on 
the 
rear 
wheel 
brakes, 
locking 
them 
(on 
some 
versions 
the 
parking 
brake 
acts 
on 
the 
front 
brakes 
too). 


In 
the 
event 
of 
the 
supply 
failing, 
this 
system 
automatically 
brakes 
the 
vehicle. 


BRAKES 


The 
front 
and 
rear 
brakes, 
depending 
on 
the 
version, 
may 
be 
disc 
or 
drum 
brakes. 


Disc 
Brakes 


For 
the 
disc 
brakes, 
the 
discs 
are 
keyed 
onto 
the 
wheel 
hubs 
and 
equipped 
with 
ventilation 
fins 
that 
permit 
lowering 
the 
high 
temperature 
generated 
under 
the 
braking 
action. 
The 
brake 
linings 
are 
fitted 
with 
a 
wear 
indicator 
connected 
to 
an 
indicator 
light 
on 
the 
dashboard 
to 
signal 
brake 
lining 
wear. 
The 
phonic 
wheels 
of 
the 
ABS 
device 
are 
keyed 
onto 
the 
wheel 
hubs. 
The 
versions 
with 
disc 
brakes 
are 
equipped 
with: 


-brake 
calipers 
type 
KNORR 
SN7; 


-disc 
brakes 
ÿ 
432 
x 
45 
mm. 


Drum 
Brakes 


For 
the 
drum 
brakes, 
each 
braking 
assembly 
is 
composed 
of 
a 
body 
housing 
the 
adjustment 
pins, 
control 
pins 
and 
wedge 
units. 
The 
wedge 
units 
are 
operated 
by 
the 
stem 
of 
the 
cylinders 
that 
in 
their 
turn 
are 
operated 
by 
compressed 
air. 
The 
wedge 
unit 
rollers, 
as 
they 
travel, 
cause 
the 
control 
pins 
to 
expand 
that, 
overcoming 
the 
resistance 
of 
the 
shoe 
return 
springs, 
bring 
the 
shoes 
up 
to 
the 
drum 
to 
actuate 
braking. 
The 
adjustment 
and 
control 
pins 
are 
made 
integral 
with 
the 
brake 
body 
by 
two 
pins 
that 
fit 
into 
a 
side 
slot. 
When 
the 
braking 
action 
ends, 
there 
is 
no 
air 
pressure 
in 
the 
diaphragm 
section 
of 
the 
combined 
brake 
cylinders 
and 
so 
the 
action 
of 
the 
wedge 
unit 
return 
and 
shoe 
return 
springs 
take 
the 
wedge 
units 
back 
into 
the 
starting 
position. 
The 
brake 
linings 
are 
fitted 
with 
a 
wear 
indicator. 
The 
phonic 
wheels 
of 
the 
ABS 
device 
are 
keyed 
onto 
the 
wheel 
hubs.

CHECKS 
ON 
MAIN 
COMPONENTS 
OF 
BRAKE 
SYSTEM 


Since 
the 
vehicle 
system 
is 
type 
approved 
to 
European 
code 
standards, 
it 
is 
vital 
to 
periodically 
check 
its 
efficiency 
and 
that 
of 
the 
relevant 
components 
with 
the 
device 
99305117. 
These 
checks 
should 
be 
carried 
out 
with 
the 
vehicle 
stationary, 
using 
the 
compressed 
air 
of 
the 
tanks 
filled 
by 
the 
compressor, 
with 
the 
engine 
started. 


!
Always 
lock 
the 
vehicle 
before 
doing 
any 
work. 
Periodically 
check 
the 
pressure 
gauges, 
comparing 
them 
with 
a 
sample 
pressure 
gauge.

check 
whether 
the 
air 
drier 
works 
properly. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
(Air 
Processing 
Unit) 
air 
needs 
to 
come 
out 
of 
the

without 
there 
being 
any 
trace 
of 
condensation 
water.

Pipes and fittings 
Check themetal pipes are in a perfect state, with no dents or cranks; 
the polyamide pipesmust have no cracking or cuts. Checkmoreover 
they are far fromsharp edges of the bodywork and chassis that could 
damage them. Check that all the pipe brackets are firmly secured, 
their slackening causes vibration with the ensuing risk of breakage. 
Check that the polyamide pipes have not come into contact with 
oil or mineral grease, rubber solvents. Press forcefully on the brake 
pedal and check the pipes do not swell. Check there is no leakage 
from the various fittings or it will be necessary to tighten them fully, 
but taking care not to cause any abnormal torsion on the pipes. In 
all the above cases it is necessary to replace the relevant parts if there 
is even the slightest doubt about their efficiency. Apart from their 
conditions, it is advisable to replace the flexible hoses after 
considerable mileage or after a lengthy period of using the vehicle 
in order to prevent sudden bursting due to ageing and fatigue. 
Seal of pneumatic system 
with engine off and under 
activation pressure 
This check is carried out by introducing air pressure into the system 
of no less than 5 bars, spreading fairly dense soapy water over the 
couplings and fittings with a soft brush and seeing there is no leakage. 
Air leakage corresponding to a soap bubble of ÿ 25mmin 5 seconds 
is tolerated, or anyhow a max. fall in pressure within 10 min. of 2% 
of the disengagement pressure = 0.22 + 0.02 bars. 
Seal of pneumatic system in the 
partial braking range with 3 bars 
For 3min. the pressure has to remain stable in the pneumatic system. 
This check should be made with the parking brake disengaged.

Its function is to keep the air clean and at the right moisture level in the system. 
In addition, it has to distribute and keep the pressure needed for the operation of the connected systems at the outlet. 
On CM (Movable Body) vehicles, the component is used with a setting of 12.5 bars, while versions below this one have a setting 
of 10.5 bars. 
The A.P.U. contains two pressure sensors connected with an MUX systemto display the front/rear axle pressure on the Cluster.

It is self-limited, that is it limits the delivery of air at a set

availability of energy and a constant maximum braking 
pressure irrespective of the pressure swings in the tanks.

This device brakes the driving wheels, via the brake anti-lock 
modulator, whenever a tendency for one or more driving 
wheels to skid is detected. 
The valve is normally closed.When the electronic control unit 
detects a tendency to skid of one or more driving wheels, it 
sends a signal to the solenoid valve, which energizes and lets 
air pass to the brake anti-lock modulators that brake the 
wheels. The solenoid valve de-energizes when the wheels 
have reached the right degree of friction on the road surface. 
35384 
526713 Speed sensor 
566712 Phonic wheels 
35383 
The speed sensors and phonic wheels have the job of 
detecting the speeds of the respective wheels. 
The phonic wheel is housed on the wheel hub and turns at 
the same speed as the wheel. It generates alternating voltages 
in the sensors by induction. The frequency of these voltages 
is in proportion to the speed of rotation of the respective 
wheel. These voltage signals are transmitted to the control 
unit to be suitably processed. A sensor and a phonic wheel 
are fitted for each wheel. This arrangement makes it possible 
to control an individual braking pressure for each wheel 
during adjustment, optimizing travelling stability and braking 
distance. 
526724 Electro-pneumatic valve for ASR 526711 Electronic control unit 
73925 
A = ABS ó EBL electronic control unit 
B = EBS electronic control unit 
Its purpose is to control the brake system, producing 
deceleration in relation to the parameters detected by the 
various system components. 
The electronic control unit is equipped with a highly 
advanced self-diagnosis system and it is able to identify and 
save any trouble, even of an intermittent nature, occurring to 
the systemduring operation, in relation to the environmental 
conditions, ensuring the most correct and reliable repairs. 
Compared to the ABS control unit, the EBS control unit is 
able to govern auxiliary deceleration systems (exhaust brake 
and Retarder), optimizing the action so as to ensure better 
system operation and moreover reduce brake lining wear. 
Figure 70 
Pressure sensor 
In ABS/EBL systems, its job is to informthe electronic control 
unit of the extent of action required by the driver. 
In EBS systems, this component is integrated in the front axle, 
rear axle and trailer control valves.

Visually check the conditions of the dust caps, if 
deformed or broken it is necessary to replace them. 
This requires removing the brake calliper, so it is 
recommended to remove the brake calliper body 
together with the bearing plate for a thorough 
overhaul. 
Check that the calliper slides freely on its guides. 
If you find any trouble on a single brake calliper it is wise to 
overhaul both brake callipers completely. 
Remove the dirt from the brake calliper with a wire brush, 
without damaging the dust caps. 
Clean the sliding surfaces of the brake linings. 
Check the conditions of the brake disc and make sure it is not 
corroded, scored or grooved. Light surface cracks are 
acceptable, but it is necessary to grind the brake disc as 
described under the relevant section heading. On the 
contrary, if it is worn, replace the brake disc. 
If one needs to be replaced, it is recommended to replace 
both brake discs. 
Check the state of the springs and wear sensors, replace them 
if necessary.

Remove dirt and rust from around the edge of the brake disc 
with a scraper or an old screwdriver (2) resting on the calliper

Finish the job with abrasive cloth. Remove the remains with 
the aid of an aspirator, or rags and a brush. 
Do not use petrol or other petroleum products that could 
cause trouble for the brakes. 
Use only methylated spirit or isopropyl alcohol. 
Carefully clean the surfaces of the braking area of the brake 
disc. 
Remove the plug (3). Turn the adjustment device (1) 
operating on the adapter counterclockwise with a wrench, to 
insert the pistons within the caliper body and extract brake 
linings (4), suitably moving the caliper body (3). 
! 
Never operate directly on the registration pinion (1) 
without having first of all fitted the adapter (2). If the 
cutting torque of the adapter is exceeded, this will 
break. 
Test with a new adapter. If this also breaks, the caliper 
must be replaced because it is damaged.

Place the caliper on the bench and block it in a vice. Use the 
wrench (4) to operate the clearance recovery device so that 
the piston (1) comes out of the caliper body for a maximum 
of 30 mm (value A). 
Take off the dust-guard from the caliper body and use tool 
99372238 (5) to remove the thrust pressing devices (1) of the 
caliper together with the protection casings (3). 
Component part cleaning and check 
To wash metal parts, use a solution of hot waterwith Fiat LCD 
detergent. Use a metal brush to remove dirt from the caliper 
body and then a little brush to remove the residuals and to 
clear accurately the guide pin and the sliding bush housings. 
Use a synthetic brush with the right dimensions to remove the 
grease left on the sliding bush housings. 
Clean the caliper body accurately with compressed air. 
Use a piece of cloth soaked with isopropyl alcohol or similar 
to clean the sliding bushes accurately. 
Check the wear conditions of the sliding bushes and their 
housings on the brake caliper body. Make sure they are not 
damaged orworn, especially the sliding surfaces. Fit the bushes 
in their housings and check they slide regularly. 
Fit the bushes in their housings, check they slide correctly, 
otherwise replace or restore their housings on the caliper 
body, if needed. 
! 
Value A must not be overcome because threaded 
hoses (2) are synchronised. If the threaded hoses (2) 
reach their over-travel, they loose synchronism and 
the brake caliper must be replaced. The brake caliper 
inner parts must never be removed. 
For this reason you are recommended non to slacken 
or to remove the cover retaining screws.. 
! 
Regular braking depends mainly on the brake caliper 
sliding on the guide pins. 
Check the wear conditions of the brake lining retaining pins 
and the related safety pins. If they are worn or damaged, 
replace the worn parts. 
It is advisable to replace all rubber and plastic parts and the 
brass bush even if they do not seemdamaged or worn at sight. 
Assembly 
Make sure all the brake caliper components are perfectly 
clean. Possible abrasive residuals should be removed with a 
cloth soaked in isopropyl alcohol or similar.

The purpose of the air-conditioning system is to make the 
cab comfortable as regards the following parameters: 
- temperature and relative humidity of outside air; 
- temperature and relative humidity in the cab. 
The system subjects the air to thermodynamic 
transformations that affect its temperature, relative humidity 
and purity. This is accomplished by: 
- ventilation, or introducing air taken from the outside 
(therefore with the temperature and humidity of the 
surrounding environment) into the cab; 
- air-conditioning, or cooling and de-humidifying the air, 
with the possibility of heating it afterwards as preferred 
so as to change the temperature and humidity in the cab. 
CAB INTERNAL VENTILATION DIAGRAM 
VENTILATION 
Description 
Ventilation is the function of drawing in fresh air from the 
outside, cleaned of pollen and dust by a special filter, or 
recycling the air in the cab. 
This system is composed of a shell, designed to house the 
electric fan unit, air ducts, fresh air intake and recycled air 
intake. The electric fan has several speeds to draw in and 
circulate large masses of air.

Description 


This 
is 
accomplished 
by 
integrating 
an 
air-conditioning 
and 
a 
heating 
system. 


This 
integration 
makes 
it 
possible 
to 
change 
the 
temperature 
and 
humidity 
in 
the 
cab. 


Air-conditioning 


Air-conditioning 
is 
accomplished 
by 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the 
high 
capacity 
of 
some 
gases 
to 
lower 
temperature 
considerably 
in 
their 
phase 
of 
expansion, 
thereby 
making 
it 
possible 
to 
absorb 
heat 
from 
the 
cab. 


This 
condition 
is 
obtained 
by 
two 
different 
levels 
of 
pressure 
(high, 
when 
the 
refrigerant 
fluid 
is 
in 
its 
liquid 
state, 
and 
low, 
when 
the 
fluid 
is 
in 
its 
gaseous 
state)

Heating 
is 
accomplished 
by 
a 
radiator, 
in 
the 
heater 
unit, 
in 


which 
the 
engine 
coolant 
circulates. 
Special 
doors 
allow 
air 
to 
pass 
through 
the 
radiator 
only 
when 
the 
heating 
function 
is 
activated. 


The 
main 
components 
of 
the 
air-conditioning 
and

system 
comprise: 
-compressor; 
-condenser; 
-the 
dehumidifier

The dehumidifier filter is integrated in the condenser that is found on the front of the vehicle. 
The refrigeration system uses R134a fluid highlighted on the plate on its casing. 
The safety pressure switch assembly with four levels is fitted on the condenser outlet pipe. 
The two pressure switches, which are of the N/C and N/O type, make it possible to keep the pressure in the system constant 
from a minimum of 2.5 (N/O) to a maximum of 25 bars (N/C); with values outside this range the system is deactivated. 
Whereas, the two pressure switches of theN/O type are used to disconnect the engine cooling fan coil when the systempressure 
is in the interval 18 ˜ 22 bars. This is accomplished by an earth signal that the two pressure switches supply to the Body Computer 
control unit.

RECOVERING REFRIGERANT 
FROM THE VEHICLE SYSTEM 
Before starting to disconnect the pipes from the 
air-conditioner, check whether it is possible to do the repairs 
without discharging the gas. 
If this is not possible, the following operations must be carried 
out: 
- connect the pipemarked HIGHunder the pressure gauge 
to the evaporator inlet (the inlet is the one on the 
pipe with a smaller diameter (H) connecting the drier 
filter with the evaporator); 
- connect the pipemarkedLOWunder the pressure gauge 
to the evaporator outlet (the outlet is the one on the pipe 
with a larger diameter (L) connecting the evaporatorwith 
the drier); 
- open the valves V1 and V2; 
- open the LOW and HIGH cocks;

FILLING 
THE 
SYSTEM 
WITH 
REFRIGERANT 


Before 
refilling, 
it 
is 
wise 
to 
be 
aware 
of 
some 
important 
rules: 


-know 
the 
quantity 
of 
refrigerant 
to 
use 
(it 
is 
normally 
written 
on 
an 
adhesive 
plate 
affixed 
on 
the 
vehicle); 


-the 
filler 
cylinder 
is 
equipped 
with 
a 
minimum 
level 
check 
that 
prevents 
introducing 
incondensable 
gas 
into 
the 
system. 
This 
is 
why 
the 
last 
approx. 
600 
g 
of 
refrigerant 
it 
contains 
cannot 
be 
used; 


-therefore, 
before 
filling, 
check 
that 
the 
cylinder 
contains 
a 
sufficient 
quantity 
for 
filling 
(maximum 
quantity 
that 
can 
be 
used 
3800 
g); 


-if 
the 
pressure 
inside 
the 
filler 
cylinder 
indicated 
on 
the 
pressure 
gauge 
(2) 
is 
greater 
than 
as 
required, 
which 
can 
be 
seen 
on 
the 
filler 
cylinder 
window 
approx. 
10 
bar 
max, 
discharge 
the 
excess 
pressure 
through 
the 
valve 
(1) 
on 
the 
pressure 
gauge 
assembly 
to 
bring 
it 
down 
to 
the 
right 
level, 
reading 
the 
value 
on 
the 
pressure 
gauge. 


Figure 
25 


2 


1 


!
To 
transfer 
refrigerant 
from 
an 
external 
bottle 
to 
the 
filler 
cylinder 
and 
vice 
versa, 
refer 
to 
the 
equipment 
manual. 


Considering 
that 
the 
amount 
of 
refrigerant 
depends 
on 
its 
pressure, 
to 
know 
the 
actual 
weight 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
turn 
the 
outside 
of 
the 
filler 
cylinder 
so 
the 
line 
of 
the 
diagram 
matches 
the 
level 
viewer. 
In 
this 
way 
we 
can 
know 
the 
exact 
quantity 
of 
refrigerant 
in 
the 
cylinder 
(starting 
weight). 


When 
calculating 
the 
weight 
of 
the 
refrigerant, 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
600 
g 
that 
cannot 
be 
used, 
remember 
to 
increase 
the 
load 
by 
approximately 
100 
g 
(this 
is 
the 
weight 
of 
refrigerant 
contained 
in 
the 
station-system 
connecting 
pipes). 
The 
right 
quantity 
of 
refrigerant 
to 
introduce 
into 
the 
system 
will 
therefore 
be 
given 
by: 
600 
g 
+ 
100 
g 
+ 
(quantity 
referred 
to 
the 
system 
capacity). 


Always 
check 
before 
filling 
that 
the 
indicator 
on 
the 
îconsoleî 
shows 
the 
refrigerant 
contains 
no 
moisture, 
in 
which 
case 
the 
indicator 
will 
be 
bright 
green. 
If 
this 
is 
not 
so, 
replace 
the 
filters 
in 
the 
station 
as 
instructed 
in 
the 
equipment 
manual.

it 
possible 
to 
identify

extremely 
accurately 
in 
the 
order 
of 
3.3 
g 
a 
year 
with 
the 
switch 
on 
maximum 
sensitivity. 


This 
instrument 
requires 
no 
settings, 
the 
operator 
only 
needs 


to 
select 
the 
desired 
sensitivity. 
The 
instrument 
warns 
the 
operator 
of 
any 
gas 
leakage 
with 
a 
buzzer 
and 
a 
LED 
that 
flashes 
in 
proportion 
to 
the 
concentration 
of 
gas. 


In 
addition, 
the 
LED 
indicates 
the 
battery 
is 
flat 
if 
it 
goes 
out. 
Operating 
temperature 
is 
between 
0 
C 
and 
50∞C. 
The 
instrument 
is 
equipped 
with 
a 
flexible 
probe 
to 
reach 


particularly 
difficult 
fittings 
or 
parts. 
The 
two 
levels 
of 
sensitivity 
are: 
-low 
sensitivity 
= 
16.5 
g/year; 


-high 
sensitivity 
= 
3.3 
g/year. 


!
Before 
checking 
vehicles, 
wait 
for 
the 
engine 
to 
cool, 
the 
hot 
parts 
can 
falsify 
the 
test.

The 
Extra 
Plan 
operations 
(designated 
with 
the 
letters 
EP) 
are 
complementary 
to 
standard 
services. 
They 
are 
maintenance 
operations 
to 
be 
carried 
out 
at 
regular 
time 
or 
mileage 
intervals 
and 
concern 
optional 
components 
that 
are 
not 
present 
on 
all 
models. 
Important! 
The 
correlation 
between 
kilometres 
and 
months 
only 
applies 
in 
cases 
where 
the 
distance 
travelled 
by 
the 
vehicle 
corresponds 
roughly 
to 
the 
specified 
average 
annual 
mileage. 
This 
is 
indicated 
only 
in 
order 
to 
suggest 
a 
hypothetical 
maintenance 
programme,. 
Note 
that 
the 
time 
intervals 
specified 
for 
Extra 
Plan 
operations 
are 
to 
be 
adhered 
to 
regardless 
of 
the 
actual 
mileage 
covered. 


!
The 
kilometre 
frequency 
for 
engine 
lubrication 
is 
in 
relation 
to 
a 
percentage 
of 
sulphur 
in 
diesel 
of 
under 
0.5%. 
NOTE: 
If 
using 
diesel 
with 
a 
percentage 
of 
sulphur 
above 
0.5%, 
the 
oil-change 
frequency 
has 
to 
be 
halved. 


Use

!
-If 
ACEA 
E2 
engine 
oil 
is 
used, 
the 
engine 
oil 
shall 
be 
changed 
every 
40.000 
km. 
-In 
the 
case 
of 
very 
low 
annual 
mileage 
of 
less 
than 
80,000 
km/year, 
the 
engine 
oil 
and 
filters 
must 
be 
changed 
every 


12 
months. 


-If 
mineral 
oil 
is 
used 
in 
the 
gearbox, 
the 
interval 
between 
gearbox 
oil 
changes 
is 
to 
be 
reduced 
to 
150,000 
km. 


-In 
case 
of 
low 
annual 
mileage, 
the 
transmission 
(automatic 
transmission 
excluded) 
and 
rear 
axle 
oil 
shall 
be 
changed 


at 
least 
every 
2 
years. 


-The 
filter 
dryer 
of 
the 
pneumatic 
system 
must 
in 
any 
case 
be 
renewed 
every 
year. 


-In 
the 
case 
of 
very 
low 
annual 
mileage, 
general 
greasing 
must 
be 
carried 
out 
at 
least 
once 
a 
year. 


-In 
the 
case 
of 
very 
low 
annual 
mileage, 
change 
the 
anti-pollen 
filters 
at 
least 
once 
a 
year. 


-Premature 
clogging 
of 
the 
air 
cleaner 
is 
generally 
due 
to 
the 
operating 
conditions. 
The 
filter 
should 
therefore 
be 
renewed 
whenever 
clogging 
is 
signalled 
by 
the 
sensor 
regardless 
of 
the 
prescribed 
time 
interval, 
which 
should 
in 
any

Change pollen filter 
Every six months 
Check the state of clogging of the pollen filter (1). 
It is reached by lifting the front radiator cowling and 
unscrewing the six supporting screws. 
! 
Excessive clogging of the pollen filters can cause a 
reduction in the flow rate of air into the cab and 
therefore less ventilation. 
This will be highlighted especially by a significant 
reduction in the efficiency of the windscreen 
defrosting function.

the cap (2). 
85505 
Take off the cap (2) and draw off a sample of the coolant 
from the expansion tank (3) with the densimeter 99395858. 
Depending on the temperature of the liquid, check the 
percentage of antifreeze in the liquid on the scale of the 
instrument. The percentage has to be higher than 40% and 
must not exceed 50%. 
If necessary, restore the percentage of antifreeze, bearing in 
mind that the liquid needs to be replaced every 2 years. 
! 
For vehicles fitted with an additional heater, the 
percentage of antifreeze must never exceed 50%.

Take off the plug (1) (after unhooking the transmitter) of the 
hydraulic power steering tank and check that with the engine 
running and the wheels travelling in a straight line, the oil level 
reaches the top reference mark on the dipstick. 
With the engine stationary and wheels in a straight line, the 
oil level has to exceed the top reference mark of the dipstick 
by 1 or 2 cm; if necessary, top up the level by taking off the 
cover (1). 
Visually check that the belts (1-2) are neither worn nor 
deteriorated; if they are, change them as described in theM2

circuit as described on the previous pages. 
Unscrew the pre-filter (1) and replace it. 
Before refitting the new cartridge, moisten the seal with

- With the gearbox warm, take off the plug(s) (1) and 
drain the oil into a specific container. 
- The oil should be drained off taking care not to soil the 
cross member beneath as it is near the outlet on some

ï Check pollen filters 
Every six months 
Check the state of clogging of the pollen filter (1). 
It is reached by lifting the front radiator cowling and 
unscrewing the six supporting screws. 
! 
Excessive clogging of the pollen filters can cause a 
reduction in the flow rate of air into the cab and 
therefore less ventilation. 
This will be highlighted especially by a significant 
reduction in the efficiency of the windscreen 
defrosting function. 
6. Wash radiator grille 
Lift the cab radiator cowling and carefully clean the radiator 
grille. 
T2 SERVICE 
4. Check percentage of antifreeze in the 
engine coolant 
! 
The plug (1) must never be taken out for any reason 
whatsoever. 
With the engine warm, the cooling system is in 
overpressure, therefore take care when taking off 
the cap (2). 
72588 
Take off the cap (2) and draw off a sample of the coolant 
from the expansion tank (3) with the densimeter 99395858. 
Depending on the temperature of the liquid, check the 
percentage of antifreeze in the liquid on the scale of the 
instrument. The percentage has to be higher than 40% and 
must not exceed 50%. 
If necessary, restore the percentage of antifreeze, bearing in 
mind that the liquid needs to be replaced every 2 years. 
! 
For vehicles fitted with an additional heater, the 
percentage of antifreeze must never exceed 50%.

The clutch fluid is poisonous and corrosive: if you 
accidentally come into contact with it, wash 
immediately with water and a neutral soap. 
Figure 67 
Figure 68 
After changing the fluid, bleed the hydraulic clutch control 
system. 
Use the air bleeding tool 99306010 as follows: 
- charge reservoir (5) with compressed air; 
- fill reservoir (4) with Tutela TRUCK DOT SPECIAL fluid 
- replace the cap (.) of the clutch fluid reservoir with one 
of the caps supplied with the tool 99306010 and 
connect the pipe to the cap.

- Attach a plastic tube to the bleed screw (2) on the slave 
cylinder (1) and immerse the opposite end of the tube 
in a container containing Tutela TRUCK DOT SPECIAL 
fluid, unscrew the bleed screw (1) by one full turn, open 
the valve (2) (see Figure 52) until a pressure reading of 
1 to 1.2 bar is obtained on the pressure gauge (3); 
- when the clutch fluid flowing through the tube is uniform 
and free of air bubbles, close the bleed screw and 
discharge the air fromthe reservoir (5) through valve (6).

components 



Do 
not 
ever 
disconnect 
the 
batteries 
from 
the 
system 
with 
the 
engine 
running. 


Do 
not 
start 
the 
engine 
without 
first 
having 
connected 
the

in 
a 
permanent 
manner. 


ó 
Before 
working 
on 
the 
vehicle, 
immobilise 
the 
wheels 
with 
chocks. 
ó 
Do 
not 
use 
fast 
chargers 
to 
start 
the 
engine. 
Engine 
starting 
can 
be 
performed 
either 
by 
means 
of 
separate 
batteries 
or 
by 
means 
of 
a 
special 
truck. 
ó 
Incorrect 
polarisation 
of 
the 
power 
supply 
voltage 
for 
the 
electronic 
control 
units 
(e.g. 
erroneous 
battery 
polarisation) 
may 
damage 
the 
components 
irreversibly. 
ó 
If 
you 
have 
to 
disconnect 
the 
batteries 
from 
the 
system, 
always 
disconnect 
the 
frame 
ground 
cable 
from 
the 
negative 
terminal 
of 
the 
batteries 
first. 
ó 
Before 
connecting 
the 
batteries 
to 
the 
system, 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
system 
is 
suitably 
insulated. 
ó 
Disconnect 
the 
batteries 
from 
the 
system 
before 
recharging 
them 
by 
means 
of 
an 
external 
unit. 
ó 
Disconnect 
the 
external 
recharging 
unit 
from 
the 
power 
mains 
before 
removing 
the 
unitís 
pliers 
from 
the 
battery 
terminals. 
ó 
At 
temperatures 
of 
over 
80 
∞C 
(drier 
ovens), 
take 
down 
the 
ECUís. 
ó 
At 
the 
connection 
stage, 
tighten 
the 
flanged 
nuts 
of 
the 
connectors 
(temperature 
and 
pressure 
sensors, 
etc.) 
to 
he 
required 
torque. 
Check 
the 
exact 
polarity 
of 
the 
battery 
terminals 
when 
starting 
the 
engine 
by 
means 
of 
the 
auxiliary 
truck. 
ó 
Before 
working 
on 
the 
vehicleís 
electrical/electronic 
system 
disconnect 
the 
positive 
pole 
of 
the 
battery. 
ó 
Before 
disconnecting 
the 
connector 
from 
an 
electronic 
control 
unit, 
isolate 
the 
system. 
ó 
Do 
not 
cause 
sparks 
to 
check 
whether 
a 
circuit 
is 
live. 
ó 
Do 
not 
use 
a 
test 
bulb 
to 
check 
the 
continuity 
of 
a 
circuit. 
Only 
use 
the 
appropriate 
testing 
devices. 
ó 
Do 
not 
directly 
power 
the 
components 
associated 
with 
electronic 
control 
units 
with 
the 
nominal 
power 
rating 
of 
the 
vehicle. 
ó 
Make 
sure 
that 
the 
wirings 
of 
electronic 
devices 
(length, 
type 
of 
cable, 
location, 
grouping, 
connection 
of 
screen 
braiding, 
earthing, 
etc.) 
conform 
with 
the 
IVECO 
system 
and 
that 
they 
are 
carefully 
restored 
after 
repair 
or 
maintenance 
work. 
To 
avoid 
the 
possible 
malfunctioning 
of 
the 
electronic 
systems 
on 
board, 
the 
wirings 
of 
additional 
devices 
must 
follow 
a 
different 
path 
than 
that 
of 
the 
above-mentioned 
systems. 
ó 
Do 
not 
connect 
the 
negative 
terminals 
of 
additional 
systems 
to 
the 
negative 
terminals 
of 
electronic 
systems. 
ó 
In 
the 
event 
of 
electric 
welding 
on 
the 
vehicle, 
disconnect 
all 
the 
electronic 
control 
units 
and/or 
disconnect 
the 
power 
cable 
from 
the 
battery 
positive 
terminal 
and 
connect 
it 
to 
the 
frame 
earth. 
ó 
Connectors 
are 
viewed 
from 
the 
cable 
side. 
Key 
storage 
procedures 
are 
affected 
by 
electromagnetic 
disturbances 
such 
as 
cell 
phones 
and 
the 
like. 
Therefore, 
during 
key 
memorization: 


1. 
Ensure 
there 
are 
no 
sources 
of 
disturbance 
in 
the 
cab 
or 
close 
to 
the 
keys. 
2. 
Keys 
not 
inserted 
in 
the 
panel 
must 
be 
at 
a 
distance 
of 
at 
least 
1 
meter. 
When 
working 
on 
electronic 
control 
units, 
plug 
connections 
and 
electrical 
connections 
to 
the 
components, 
measurements 
can 
be 
made 
only 
on 
suitable 
testing 
lines, 
by 
means 
of 
special 
plugs 
and 
plug-type 
bushes. 
Do 
not 
under 
any 
circumstances 
make 
use 
of 
improper 
devices 
such 
as 
metal 
wires, 
screwdrivers, 
clips 
and 
the 
like. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
risk 
of 
causing 
a 
short 
circuit, 
this 
might 
damage 
plug-type 
connections 
and 
this 
would 
then 
give 
rise 
to 
contact 
problems.

INTRODUCTION 
STRALIS 
AT/AD 


Practical 
tips 


The 
negative 
leads 
connected 
to 
a 
system 
grounding 
point 
must 
be 
as 
short 
as 
possible 
and 
connected 
to 
one 
another 
in 
îstarî 
configuration; 
make 
sure 
that 
they 
are 
tightened 
in 
an 
orderly 
and 
adequate 
manner 
(Fig. 
1, 
ref. 
M). 


Furthermore, 
for 
electronic 
components, 
the 
instructions 
to 
be 
followed 
very 
carefully 
are: 


ó 
ECUís 
must 
be 
connected 
to 
the 
system 
ground 
if 
they 
are 
provided 
with 
a 
case. 
ó 
ECU 
negative 
cables 
must 
be 
connected 
both 
to 
a 
system 
grounding 
point, 
such 
as 
for 
instance 
the 
dash 
compartment 
ground 
(with 
no 
îserialî 
or 
îchainî 
connections) 
and 
to 
the 
negative 
terminal(s) 
of 
the 
battery/batteries. 
ó 
Even 
though 
they 
are 
not 
connected 
to 
the 
system 
ground/battery 
negative 
terminals, 
analogue 
ground 
elements 
(sensors) 
must 
have 
excellent 
insulation. 
As 
a 
result, 
special 
care 
must 
be 
devoted 
to 
the 
eddy 
resistances 
of 
the 
cable 
terminals: 
oxidation, 
seam-folding 
defects, 
etc. 
ó 
The 
metal 
braid 
of 
shielded 
circuits 
must 
be 
in 
electrical 
contact 
at 
either 
end 
with 
system 
components. 
ó 
Only 
one 
end 
of 
the 
shielding 
braid 
must 
be 
connected 
to 
the 
system 
ground. 
ó 
In 
the 
presence 
of 
jointing 
connectors, 
the 
non-shielded 
portion, 
d, 
must 
be 
as 
short 
as 
possible 
in 
the 
proximity 
of 
the 
connectors 
(Fig. 
2). 
ó 
The 
cables 
must 
be 
arranged 
so 
as 
to 
run 
parallel 
to 
the 
reference 
plane, 
i.e., 
as 
close 
as 
possible 
to 
the 
frame/body 
structure. 
ó 
Additional 
electromechanical 
systems 
must 
be 
connected 
with 
the 
greatest

the 
absence 
of 
the 
three 
units 
DDM, 
PDM, 
CM. 
The 
only 
function 
that 
can 
be 
found 
on 
AT/AD 
models 
(previously 
managed 
by 
PDM 
and 
DDM) 
is 
rearview 
mirrors 
heating. 
Drive 
is 
given 
by 
switch 
52005 
(rearview 
mirrors 
heating 
connection) 
placed 
on 
central 
panel 
(on 
AS 
it 
was 
placed 
on 
panel 
in 
driver

door). 


Electric 
windscreen

drive 
and 
headlight

functions 
on 
AT/AD 
are 
managed 
by 
FFC 
unit 
(same 
unit 
being 
present 
on 
AS) 
since 
CABIN 
MODULE 
being 
present 
on 
AS 
on 
AT/AD 
is 
optional. 
These 
functions 
go 
back 
under 
CM 
module 
competence 
when 
this 
latter 
one 
is 
present. 
The 
îinsufficient 
windscreen 
washing 
liquid 
level 
indicatorî 
signal 
is 
directly 
present 
on 
BODY 
COMPUTER. 


The 
mechanical 
pump 
is 
used 
for 
cabin 
overturning, 
therefore 
all 
components 
related 
to 
electric 
pump 
are 
removed 
For 
cabin 
disconnection 
signals, 
the 
two 
parallely-connected 
switches 
53511 
are 
not 
present, 
while 
instead 
there 
is 
only 
one 
of 
them 
that 
is 
connected 
through 
connector 
ST31. 


General 
current 
remote 
control 
switch 
TGC 
is 
optional, 
when 
it 
is 
not 
present 
it 
is 
replaced 
by 
general 
current 
switch 
IGC 
(52600). 
In 
this 
case 
there 
are 
two 
Main 
Relays 
(25924). 


Two 
lighting 
lamps 
for 
cigarette 
compartment 
have 
been 
added. 


On 
AT 
there 
are: 
tooling 
compartment 
light, 
control 
switch 
and 
BED 
MODULE 
unit 
(OPT, 
as 
an 
alternative 
the 
control 
panel 
on 
rear 
wall). 


The 
two 
central 
spots 
have 
been 
replaced 
by 
a 
single 
central 
roof 
lamp, 
white 
and 
red 
lights 
are 
replaced 
by 
white 
side 
roof 
lamps. 


Parking 
brake 
hand 
lever 
on 
AT/AD 
models 
has 
been 
moved 
next 
to 
central 
dashboard. 


As 
a 
result 
of 
these 
changes, 
there 
are 
modifications 
also 
on 
instrument-holder 
dashboard 
and 
central 
dashboard.

GENERAL 
DESCRIPTION 
OF 
THE 
MULTIPLEX 
SYSTEM 


Connection 
of 
all 
the 
various 
centers 
can 
be 
by 
grouping 
them 
together 
into 
one 
central 
unit, 
too 
complex 
a 
solution, 
or 
by 
creating 
a 
communications 
web 
capable 
of 
completing 
all 
necessary 
data 
transfers 
fast 
and 
reliably. 
Fast 
data 
transfer 
is 
essential 
for 
managing 
vehicle 
operation 
and 
reliability 
must 
be 
guaranteed 
for 
applications 
tied 
to 
safety, 
transmission, 
brake, 
engine 
and 
electronic 
center 
control 
as 
there 
must 
be 
no 
transmission 
issue 
especially 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
electromagnetic 
influences. 


Many 
issues 
involving 
a 
vehicleís 
electrical 
circuits 
have 
to 
do 
with 
connection 
technology 
and 
can 
be 
identified 
in 
connector 
contact 
corrosion 
or 
oxidization, 
cable 
connection, 
insulating 
sheath 
wear 
or 
faulty 
assembly. 


Another 
cause 
could 
be 
sensor 
and 
actuator 
operating 
defects. 
Vehicle 
downtime 
is 
reduced 
when 
fewer 
cables 
are 
used, 
with 
consequent 
operating 
cost 
cutting. 


Cabling 
with 
fewer 
components 
enables 
performing 
easier 
electronic 
system 
diagnosis. 


Conventional 
control 


CDABCDBA
The 
electrical 
system 
currently 
installed 
on 
the 
vehicle 
requires 
that 
each 
user 
item 
be 
controlled 
directly 
by 
its 
switch, 
which 
necessarily 
requires 
the 
presence 
of 
cables 
with 
several 
conductors 
that 
involve 
the 
risks 
mentioned 
above.

DADBCCB
A 


Unlike 
the 
system 
mentioned 
above, 
each 
switch 
in 
this 
setup 
is 
connected 
to 
a 
unit. 
A 
different 
coded 
value 
for 
each 
switch 
is 
communicated 
to 
the 
CAN 
communication 
line 
Databus. 
The 
signal 
is 
decoded 
by 
a 
Demultiplexer 
unit, 
which 
supplies 
the 
power 
required 
to 
the 
user 
unit 
involved. 


Different 
transmission 
classes 
exist, 
according 
to 
Databus 
data 
transmission 
speed, 
as 
follows: 
-class 
A: 
low 
speed 
for 
vehicle 
lighting 
and 
windshield 
wiper 
motor 
control 


-class 
B: 
medium 
speed 
for 
air 
conditioning 
and 
audio 
systems 


-class 
C: 
high 
speed 
for 
ABS 
control 
systems 
and 
the 
like 


The 
advantages 
of 
the 
Multiplex 
system 
can 
be 
summarized 
into 
lesser 
costs 
due 
to 
shorter 
cables, 
increased 
functionality, 
sensor 
sharing 
by 
part 
of 
the 
various 
systems 
and 
better 
on-board 
diagnostic 
functions, 
offset 
by 
greater 
costs 
versus 
a 
conventional 
system 
and 
more 
training 
required.

All 
centers 
are 
connected 
via 
a 
Control 
Area 
Network 
CAN 
line. 
The 
MULTIPLEX 
structure 
is 
very 
flexible; 
centers 
can 
be 
removed 
or 
added 
without 
interrupting 
the 
operation 
of 
others. 
If 
node 
2 
sends 
a 
message, 
interaxed 
node 
3 
accepts 
the 
message 
while 
node 
1 
ignores 
it. 
Units 
can

the 
information 
of 
several 
sensors.

POWER 
NETWORK 



Never 
disconnect 
the 
batteries 
from 
the 
system 
with 
the 
engine 
running. 
When 
needing 
to 
disconnect 
the 
batteries 
from 
the 
system, 
always 
firstly 
disconnect 
the 
frame 
earth 
cable 
from 
thenegativeterminal 
of 
the 
batteries. 
Before 
connecting 
the 
batteries 
to 
the 
system, 
make 
sure 
that 
the 
system 
is 
well 
insulated. 
Disconnect 
the 
batteries 
from 
the 
system 
when 
charging 
them. 


The 
purpose 
of 
the 
electric 
system 
is 
to 
generate, 
regulate, 
store 
and 
distribute 
the 
energy 
needed 
to 
make 
the 
vehicle 
components 
work. 


For 
this 
reason 
the 
supply 
of 
the 
base 
electric 
system 
is 
ensured 
by 
a 
generator 
(28V 
-60A 
-90A 
alternator) 
and 
two 
batteries, 
each 
with 
12 
V 
110 
Ah 
(143 
Ah 
-170 
Ah) 
connected 
in 
series. 


A 
mobile 
fuse 
holder 
containing 
a 
20 
Amp 
fuse 
is 
located 
close 
to 
the 
batteries. 
This 
fuse 
supplies: 


-Fuse 
holder 
70601/C 


-Body 
Computer 
(J1-8) 


-Cluster 
(B20) 


-Tachograph

-Diagnosis 
connector 
(Pin 
27) 


This 
fuse 
is 
not 
present 
on 
the 
ADR 
version.

Attain 
to 
what 
detected 
on 
the 
vehicle 
for 
the 
remaining 
sections. 


Negative

The 
batteries 
are 
connected 
to 
the 
frame 
earth 
with 
abrown 
70 
mm2 
cable, 
at 
earth 
point 
M1 
on 
the 
left 
sidemember 
(Fig. 
II.3). 


The 
starter 
motor 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
frame 
earth 
(M2) 
through 
a 
70 
mm2 
cable, 
fastened 
on 
the 
right 
sidemember, 
near 
the 
actual 
motor. 
The 
same 
cable 
serves 
for 
connecting 
the 
whole 
engine 
unit 
to 
the 
frame 
earth. 


The 
same 
electric, 
negative 
equipotentiality 
of 
the 
chassis 
is 
made 
available 
to 
the 
vehicle 
cab 
by 
means 
of 
a 
stranded 
wire 
connected 
to 
the 
cab 
front 
and 
the 
front 
right 
side 
member.

Electrical equipotential braid 
Though generally protected against the influence of on-board equipment voltage, electronic components nevertheless 
remain particularly sensitive electromagnetic compatibility issues, of different nature such as: 
- generated by the vehicles 
- external. 
A suitable size flexible electrolytic copper braid has been provided on the vehicles to minimize these phenomena and 
return main cab and frame structures to the equipotential state. 
Check that the braid is properly attached to the frame and the cab, in the event of defective cab grounding.

RIGHT 
MULTIFUNCTION 
LEVER 


The 
multifunction 
lever 
located 
on 
the 
right 
side 
of 
the 
steering 
column 
enables 
insertion 
of 
the 
engine 
brake 
function 
and 
the 
intarder 
when 
installed. 


The 
former 
is 
selected 
by 
moving 
the 
lever 
to 
positions 
1 
and 
2 
and 
remains 
o 
even 
when 
the 
same 
lever 
is 
used 
to 
selected 
the 
intarder 
function 
at 
positions 
3, 
4, 
5 
and 
6 
related 
to 
available 
braking 
power 
ratings. 


When 
the 
engine 
brake 
function 
is 
selected 
the 
control 
lever 
signal 
is 
transmitted 
to 
the 
(Steering 
Wheel 
Interface) 
S.W.I. 
center. 


Which 
activates 
the 
engine 
brake 
on 
warning 
light 
on 
Instrument 
Cluster 
IC, 
and 
via 
Body 
Computer 
B.C. 
sends 
the 
request 
fro 
engine 
rake 
to 
the 
EDC, 
EBS 
and 
automated 
EuroTronic 
center 
(when 
present). 


When 
the 
operator 
selects 
the 
engine 
brake 
manually, 
selection 
is 
displayed 
in 
the 
Cluster 
with 
a 
blinking 
warning 
light, 
which 
goes 
to 
steady 
when 
the 
engine 
brake 
is 
turned 
on. 
In 
the 
manual 
mode, 
engine 
brake 
action 
is 
also 
conditioned 
by 
accelerator 
pedal 
release. 
In 
the 
automatic

is 
activated 
by 
the

on 
receipt 
of

AUTOMATIC 
AIR 
CONDITIONER 


In 
automatic 
version 
the 
system 
is 
managed 
by 
an 
electronic 
unit 
placed 
in 
the 
lower 
part 
of 
central 
dashboard 
and 
integrates 
control 
knobs. 


The 
electronic 
unit 
is 
connected 
to 
vehicle 
CAN 
BCB 
line 
and 
is 
equipped 
with 
a 
very 
advanced 
diagnostic 
system. 


The 
main 
objective 
of 
the 
unit 
is 
adjusting 
internal 
cabin 
temperature 
(set 
by 
the 
driver) 
depending 
on 
external 
temperature 
measured 
by 
a 
suitable 
sensor. 
The 
system 
provides 
for 
the 
chance 
of 
a 
completely 
automatic 
management, 
but 
anyway 
for 
the 
user 
it 
is 
always 
possible, 
if 
he 
so 
wishes, 
to 
modify 
the 
main

After 
having 
set 
the 
desired 
internal 
temperature, 
by 
placing 
the 
other 
two 
knobs 
next 
to 
letter 
A, 
the 
unit 
is 
able 
to 
automatically 
check 
the 
following 
functions: 


-Air 
temperature 
to 
unions. 
-Fan 
speed 
-Air 
flows 
distribution 
-Supplementary 
heater 
connection 
if 
external 
temperature 
is 
<5 
∞C. 


In 
this 
position 
the 
unit 
does 
NOT 
automatically 
activate 
either 
compressor 
or 
recirculation 
function: 
connection 
of 
both 
of 
them 
is 
manually 
managed 
by 
the 
driver. 


îRECIRCULATIONî 
FUNCTION 


Connection 
of 
this 
function 
is 
completely 
manual 
and 
is 
obtained 
through 
a 
suitable 
button 
that 
allows 
closing 
the 
external 
air 
intake 
by 
placing 
the 
baffle 
at 
95% 
of 
internal 
air 
and 
5% 
of 
external 
air. 
The 
unit 
automatically 
deactivates 
this 
function 
after 
about 
20 
minutes 
if 
the 
compressor 
is 
disconnected 
and 
after 
30 
minutes 
is 
the 
compressor 
is 
connected. 


îCOMPRESSOR 
CONTROLî 
FUNCTION 


Connection 
of 
this 
function 
is 
completely 
manual 
and 
is 
obtained 
through 
a 
suitable 
button 
that 
allows 
connecting 
the 
compressor 
clutch 
after 
a 
quality 
check 
of 
fluid 
in 
the 
system 
through 
safety 
pressure 
switches 
and 
evaporator 
temperature 
by 
means 
of 
the 
suitable 
sensor. 
The 
unit 
does 
NOT 
automatically 
connect 
the 
compressor. 


îSUPPLEMENTARY 
HEATER 
CONTROLî 
FUNCTION 


With 
moving 
engine 
the 
unit 
automatically 
connects 
the 
supplementary 
AIR 
and/or 
WATER 
heater 
only 
if 
the 
external 
temperature 
is 
<5 
_C. 
With 
off 
engine 
the 
heater 
connection 
depends 
on 
driverís 
setting. 


In 
both 
cases, 
the 
supplementary 
heater 
connection 
is 
signalled 
to 
the 
driver 
on 
Cluster 
display.

The 
expansion 
valve 
is 
of 
the 
union 
type 
and 
is 
placed 
between 
drier 
filter 
and 
evaporator. 


Its 
task 
is 
checking 
and 
batching 
the 
cooling 
fluid 
flow 
in 
order 
to 
obtain 
the 
maximum 
refrigerating 
power 
from 
the 
system 
and 
to 
lower 
the 
cooling 
liquid 
pressure 
(upon 
exiting 
the 
filter) 
to 
a 
pre-established 
value, 
so 
that 
the 
fluid 
itself, 
by 
then 
circulating 
into 
the 
evaporator, 
can 
be 
sucked 
by 
the 
compressor 
in 
a 
completely 
gaseous 
state. 
In 
this 
valve 
there 
are 
two 
cooling 
fluid 
passages: 


D 
The 
lower 
one 
that 
allows 
the 
cooling 
fluid 
to 
pass 
from 
drier 
filter 
(5) 
to 
evaporator 
(2). 
Along 
this 
path 
a 
spring 
(4) 
is 
placed 
that, 
suitably 
calibrated, 
allows 
obtaining 
such 
a 
temperature 
jump 
(overheating) 
as 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
cooling 
fluid, 
upon 
entry 
the 
evaporator, 
is 
completely 
in 
a 
gaseous 
state. 
Moreover 
there 
is 
also 
a 
modulating 
element, 
in 
this 
case 
a 
ball 
(3) 
housed 
in 
the 
calibrated 
duct, 
that 
checks 
the 
cooling 
fluid 
flow 
rate 
to 
the 
evaporator. 
D 
The 
upper 
one 
that 
allows 
the 
cooling 
fluid 
to 
pass 
from 
evaporator 
(1) 
to 
compressor 
(6). 
Along 
this 
path 
instead 
there 
is 
a 
temperature 
sensor 
(7) 
that, 
depending 
on 
the 
temperature 
upon 
exiting 
the 
evaporator, 
allows 
obtaining 
a 
control 
action 
on 
the 
cooling 
fluid 
flow 
rate, 
through 
the 
modulating 
and 
overheating 
checking 
element 
(3), 
through 
the 
spring 
(4).

System 
operation 


By 
connecting 
the 
burner, 
the 
electronic 
unit 
controls 
water 
pump, 
fuel 
batching 
pump, 
burner 
motor 
and 
ignition 
spark 
plug. 
The 
water 
pump 
circulates 
the 
cooling 
liquid 
in 
the 
cooling 
circuit 
of 
the 
engine 
to 
be 
heated. 
The 
burner 
motor 
sucks 
and 
inserts 
the 
right 
amount 
of 
air 
necessary 
for 
combustion. 
The 
ignition 
spark 
plug 
heats 
air 
and 
burns 
fuel 
injected 
by 
the 
batching 
pump. 


Purpose 
of 
the 
batching 
pump 
is 
taking 
and 
injecting 
fuel 
onto 
spark 
plug. 
After 
90 
seconds, 
the 
unit, 
through 
the 
flame 
sensors, 
checks 
that 
the 
exhaust 
gases 
temperature 
value 
is 
included 
between 
500 
and 
600 
∞C, 
(ignition 
has 
correctly 
occurred). 
Upon 
reaching 
about 
700 
∞C 
the 
unit 
disconnects 
the 
spark 
plug 
and 
the 
burner 
works 
in 
self-combustion. 


If 
the 
flame 
sensor 
does 
not 
measure 
the 
above 
temperature, 
thereby 
the 
burner 
is 
not 
turned 
on, 
the 
unit 
repeats 
the 
ignition 
procedure. 
If 
it 
does 
not 
start 
again, 
the 
unit 
turns 
the 
burner 
off 
and 
it 
will 
then 
be 
mandatory 
to 
manually 
switch 
it 
on 
again. 


If 
the 
heater 
does 
not 
start 
for 
three 
consecutive 
times, 
it 
is 
blocked. 


The 
unit 
checks, 
through 
water 
temperature 
sensor 
and 
overheating 
sensor, 
whether 
combustion 
and 
burner 
correctly 
operate. 
The 
water 
temperature 
sensor 
is 
used 
by 
the 
unit 
to 
adjust 
the 
burner 
working 
power 
(maximum, 
medium, 
minimum 


and 
stand 
by). 


In 
the 
manual 
version, 
upon 
reaching 
55 
_C, 
the 
system 
connects 
the 
fans 
inside 
the 
cabin. 
The 
overheating 
sensor 
is 
used 
by 
the 
unit 
to 
turn 
the 
burner 
off 
in 
case 
of 
excessive 
water 
temperature 
(about 
115 
_C). 


The 
burner 
operating 
time 
is 
determined 
by 
driverís 
settings. 
Upon 
turning 
off, 
the 
burner 
performs 
a 
washing 
phase 
that 
lasts 
for 
about 
3 
minutes 
in 
order 
to 
be 
ready 
for 
the 
following 
starting. 


The 
heater 
is 
connected 
with 
its 
own 
control 
logic 
in 
the 
air 
conditioning 
system 
and 
is 
therefore 
equipped 
with 
an 
electronic 
unit 
with 
related 
connector. 


The 
unit 
is 
directly 
assembled 
onto 
the 
heater. 
The 
heater 
can 
be 
directly 
driven 
by 
the 
automatic 
air 
conditioning 
system, 
by 
the 
version 
with 
manual 
control 
or 
through 
the 
Bed

to 
the 
EDC 
centre, 
whose 
actuator 
decodes 
and 
compares 
it 
with 
data 
stored 
during 
the 
installation 
process. 
Ignition 
is 
enabled 
if 
the

admitted. 
The

on: 
-water 
temperature 
or 
to 
prevent: 
-noise 
-fumes 
-overloads

and 
the 
like 
-serious 
defects 
involving 
load 
reduction 
or 
engine 
stop. 
After 
determining 
the 
mass 
of 
air 
introduced 
by 
measuring 
its 
volume 
and 
temperature, 
the 
center 
calculates 
in 
mg 
per 
delivery 
the 
corresponding 
mass 
of 
fuel 
to 
be 
injected 
into 
the 
cylinder 
involved, 
with 
account 
also 
taken 
of 
gas 
oil 
temperature. 
The 
mass 
of 
fuel 
thus 
calculated 
is 
first 
transformed 
into 
volume 
(in 
mm3 
per 
delivery) 
and 
then 
in 
flywheel 
degrees, 
that 
is 
to 
say 
injection 
duration. 


Delivery 
correction 
based 
on 
water

When 
cold, 
the 
engine 
encounters 
greater 
operating 
resistance, 
mechanical 
friction 
is 
high, 
oil 
is 
till 
very 
viscous 
and 
operating 
plays 
are 
not 
optimized 
yet. 
Fuel 
injected 
also 
tends 
to 
condense 
on 
cold 
metal 
surfaces. 
Fuel 
dosing 
with 
a 
cold 
engine 
is 
therefore 
greater 
than 
when 
hot.

Behaviors 
that 
could 
lead 
to 
the

under 
review 
are 
well 
known, 
so 
the 
designer 
has 
added 
specific 
instructions 
to 
the

delivery 
expressed 
in 
degrees, 
can 
differ 
from 
one 
injection 
to 
the 
next, 
even 
from 
one 
cylinder 
to 
another 
and 
is 
calculated 
similarly 
to 
delivery 
according 
to 
engine 
load, 
namely, 
accelerator 
position, 
engine 
rpm 
and 
air 
admitted. 
Lead 
is 
corrected 
as 
required: 
-during 
acceleration 
-according 
to 
water 
temperature 
and 
to 
obtain: 
-reduced 
emissions, 
noise 
abatement 
and 
no 
overload 
-better 
vehicle 
acceleration 
High 
injection 
lead 
is 
set 
at 
start, 
based 
on 
water 
temperature. 
Delivery 
start 
feedback 
is 
given 
by 
injection 
electro 
valve 
impedance 
variation. 


Speed 
adjuster 


The 
electronic 
speed 
adjuster 
features 
both 
regulator 
characteristics: 
-minimum 
and 
maximum 
-all 
rpm 
levels 
It 
remains 
stable 
in 
ranges 
where 
conventional 
mechanical 
adjusters 
become 
imprecise. 


Engine 
start 


Cylinder 
1 
step 
and 
recognition 
signal 
synchronization 
(flywheel 
and 
drive 
shaft 
sensors) 
takes 
place 
at 
first 
engine 
turns. 
Accelerator 
pedal 
signal 
is 
ignored 
at 
start. 
Star 
delivery 
is 
set 
exclusively 
based 
on 
water 
temperature, 
via 
a 
specific 
map. 
The 
center 
enables 
the 
accelerator 
pedal, 
when 
it 
detects 
flywheel 
acceleration 
and 
rpm 
such 
as 
to 
consider 
the 
engine 
as 
started 
and 
no 
longer 
drawn 
by 
the 
starter 
motor. 


Cold 
start 


Pre-post 
reheating 
is 
activated 
when 
even 
only 
one 
of 
the 
three 
water, 
air 
or 
gas 
oil 
temperature 
sensors 
records 
a 
temperature 
of 
below 
10 
_C. 
The 
pre-heat 
warning 
light 
goes 
on 
when 
the 
ignition 
key 
is 
inserted 
and 
stays 
on 
for 
a 
variable 
period 
of 
time 
according 
to 
temperature, 
while 
the 
intake 
duct 
input 
resistor 
heats 
the 
air, 
then 
starts 
blinking, 
at 
which 
point 
the 
engine 
can 
be 
started. 
The 
warning 
light 
switches 
off 
with 
the 
engine 
revving, 
while 
the 
resistor 
continues 
being 
fed 
for 
a 
variable 
period 
of 
time 
to 
complete 
post-heating. 
The 
operation 
is 
cancelled 
to 
avoid 
uselessly 
discharging 
the 
batteries 
if 
the 
engine 
is 
not 
started 
within 
20 
˜ 
25 
seconds 
with 
the 
warning 
light 
blinking. 
The 
pre-heat 
curve 
is 
also 
variable 
based 
on 
battery 
voltage. 


Hot 
start 


On 
inserting 
the 
ignition 
key 
the 
warning 
light 
goes 
on 
for 
some 
2 
seconds 
for 
a 
short 
test 
and 
then 
switches 
off 
when 
all 
reference 
temperatures 
are 
above 
10 
_C. 
The 
engine 
can 
be 
started 
at 
this 
point. 


Run 
Up 


When 
the 
ignition 
key 
is 
inserted, 
the 
center 
transfers 
data 
stored 
at 
previous 
engine 
stop 
to 
the 
main 
memory 
(Cf. 
After 
run), 
and 
diagnoses 
the 
system. 


After 
Run 


At 
each 
engine 
stop 
with 
the 
ignition 
key, 
the 
center 
still 
remains 
fed 
by 
the 
main 
relay 
for 
a 
few 
seconds, 
to 
enable 
the 
microprocessor 
to 
transfer 
some 
data 
from 
the 
main 
volatile 
memory 
to 
an 
non-volatile, 
cancelable 
and 
rewritable 
(Eeprom) 
memory 
to 
make 
tem 
available 
for 
the 
next 
start 
(Cf. 
Run 
Up). 
These 
data 
essentially 
consists 
of: 
-miscellaneous 
settings, 
such 
as 
engine 
idling 
and 
the 
like 
-settings 
of 
some 
components 
-breakdown 
memory 
The 
process 
lasts 
for 
some 
seconds, 
typically 
from 
2 
to 
7 
according 
to 
the 
amount 
of 
data 
to 
be 
stored, 
after 
which 
the 
ECU 
sends 
a 
command 
to 
the 
main 
relay 
and 
makes 
it 
disconnect 
from 
the 
battery.

This 
procedure 
must 
never 
be 
interrupted, 
by 
cutting 
the 
engine 
off 
from 
the 
battery 
cutout 
or 
disconnecting 
the 
latter 
before 
10 


seconds 
at 
least 
after 
engine 
cutout. 
In 
this 
case, 
system 
operation 
is 
guaranteed 
until 
the 
fifth 
improper 
engine 
cutout, 
after 
which 
an 
error 
is 
stored 
in 
the 
breakdown 
memory 
and 
the 
engine 
operates 
at 
lower 
performance 
at 
next 
start 
while 
the 
EDC 
warning 
light 
stays 
on. 


Repeated 
procedure 
interruptions 
could 
in 
fact 
lead 
to 
center 
damage. 


Cut-off 


This 
is 
the 
delivery 
cutout 
function 
during 
deceleration, 
engine 
braking 
and 
the 
like. 


Cylinder 
Balancing 


Individual 
cylinder 
balancing 
contributes 
to 
increasing 
comfort 
and 
operability. 
This 
function 
enables 
individual 
personalized 
fuel 
delivery 
control 
and 
delivery 
start 
for 
each 
cylinder, 
even 
differently 
between 
each 
cylinder, 
to 
compensate 
for 
injector 
hydraulic 
tolerances. 
Delivery 
flow 
differences 
between 
the 
various 
injectors 
cannot 
be 
assessed 
directly 
by 
the 
center, 
this 
information 
being 
supplied 
by 
entering 
the 
code 
for 
each 
injector 
via 
the 
Modus. 


Synchronization 
search 


The 
center 
can 
anyhow 
recognize 
the 
cylinder 
to 
inject 
fuel 
into 
even 
in 
the 
absence 
of 
a 
signal 
from 
the 
camshaft 
sensor. 
If 
this 
occurs 
when 
the 
engine 
is 
already 
started, 
combustion 
sequence 
is 
already 
acquired, 
so 
the 
center 
continues 
with 
the 
sequence 
it 
is 
already 
synchronized 
on; 
if 
it 
occurs 
with 
the 
engine 
stopped, 
the 
center 
only 
actuates 
one 
electro 
valve. 
Injection 
occurs 
onside 
that 
cylinder 
within 
2 
shaft 
revs 
at 
the 
utmost 
so 
the 
center 
is 
only 
required 
to 
synchronize 
on 
the 
firing 
sequence 
and 
start 
the 
engine. 


The 
center 
is 
mounted 
directly 
on 
the 
engine 
via 
a 
heat 
exchanger 
to 
enable 
cooling 
via 
elastic 
pads 
that 
minimize 
engine-induced 
vibration, 
to 
reduce 
the 
number 
of 
connections, 
the 
length 
of 
cables 
connecting 
with 
the 
injectors 
and 
all 
disturbances 
to 
the 
signal 
transmitted. 


It 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
vehicle 
via 
two 
35-pole 
connectors: 
connector 
ìAî 
for 
components 
present 
on 
the 
engine 
connector 
ìBî 
for 
cab 
components. 


An 
internal 
environment 
pressure 
sensor 
is 
provided 
for 
further 
improved 
injection 
system 
management. 


The 
center 
is 
provided 
with 
an 
advanced 
self-diagnosis 
system 
capable 
of 
identifying 
and 
storing 
any 
intermittent 
environmental 
anomaly 
to 
the 
system 
during 
vehicle 
operation 
to 
ensure 
the 
most 
correct 
and 
efficient 
repair.

mainly 
consists 
of 
three 
components 
as 
follows: 
A) 
Electro

B) 
Pump 
unit 
C) 
Sprayer 
These 
three 
parts 
CANNOT 
be 
replaced 
individually 
and 
are 
NOT 
subject

overhaul. 
The 
pump 
is 
actuated 
mechanically 
at 
each 
cycle 
by 
a 
rocker 
arm 
and 
compresses 
the 
fuel 
contained 
in 
the 
pressure 


chamber. 


The 
sprayer 
features 
the 
same 
assembly

operation 
as 
a 
conventional 
injector; 
it 
is 
opened 
by 
the 
fuel 
under 
pressure 


and 
injects 
it 
fine 
pulverized 
into 
the 
combustion 
chamber.

controlled 
directly 
by 
the

Pre-post reheat resistor (61121) 
This resistor located between the cylinder head and the intake duct is used to heat air in pre/post reheat operations. 
By inserting the key switch, when even only one of the water, air or gas oil temperature sensors record less than 10 
_C, the electronic center activates pre/post reheating and switches on the warning light on the cab instrument panel 
for a variable period according to temperature, after which the light starts blinking to inform the operator that the engine 
can be started. 
The warning light goes off after engine start but the resistor continues being supplied for a variable period of time to 
complete post reheating. 
The operation is cancelled to prevent uselessly discharging the battery if the engine is not started within 20/25 seconds 
with the warning light blinking. 
When reference temperature is above 10 _C, actuating the ignition key makes the warning light go on for some 2 
seconds to complete the test and then turns it of to indicate the engine can be started.

The fan features two possible rotation speeds controlled by the Front Frame Computer center by exciting the compressed air 
electro valve for slow speed and by coil (11) for second speed. 
When neither low nor second speed is activated, the fan is drawn slowly by friction forces present (neutral position). 
The parameters/systems that may require fan action via the BC center are as follows: 
- Coolant temperature 
- Conditioning system coolant pressure 
- Intarder 
Low speed is activated when: 
- Engine coolant temperature reaches 80 _C and the intarder is cut in at deceleration power under 41% of maximum. 
- Conditioner coolant pressure reaches 18 bars. 
Second speed is activated when: 
- Conditioner coolant pressure reaches 22 bars. 
- Engine coolant temperature reaches 80 _C and the intarder is cut in at deceleration power over 41% of maximum. 
- Engine coolant temperature is over 88 _C. 
When second speed activation is required, the system pilots the fan for 5 seconds at low speed, then second speed is cut in. 
This operating logic enables increasing belt and fan component reliability in time. 
When fan low speed remains cut in for over 1 minute, the system activates second speed until control parameters return below 
action limits.

When fan action is not required for proper engine operation, the Front FrameComputer center pilots the compressed air electro 
valve to move piston (8), displaces permanent magnets (3) from fan hub (2). The magnetic field generated by magnets (3) is 
not enough to move fan hub (2) by induction. 
The fan may rotate slowly due to friction present.

When low speed action is required, the Front Frame Computer center discharge air from duct (10) through the compressed 
air electro valve; piston (8) moves and draws permanent magnets (3) towards fan hub (2). Piston travel is ensured by return 
spring (7) and blades (4). 
The shaft rotates at the same speed as pulley (1) and the effect of the magnetic field generated by magnets (3) is to make fan 
hub (2) rotate at the maximum speed of 650 rpm. 
For F2B the first speed is always connected since there are no pneumatic solenoid valve nor air exhaust system inside the 
assembly.

When low speed is not enough to properly cool the engine, the Front Frame Computer center pilots second speed cut-in by 
exciting coil (11). 
The magnetic field generated by the coil attracts fan hub (2) floating ring (9) to pulley (1) making the two units solidal. 
In this condition fan speed is the same as pulley speed.

THE 
EBS 
ELECTRONIC 
BRAKE 
SYSTEM 


Increased 
competition 
in 
the 
transportation 
business 
has 
also 
caused 
increased 
basic 
braking 
system 
requirements, 
logically 
satisfied 
with 
the 
introduction 
of 
EBS 
electronic 
control 
braking 
systems. 
It 
is 
a 
permanent 
integrated 
management 
braking 
system 
for 
tractor 
and 
trailers 
that 
integrates 
ABS, 
ASR 
and 
EBL 
systems. 


The 
system 
consists 
of 
a 
compressed 
air 
and 
an 
electrical 
system 
containing 
the 
following 
components: 
Electrical 
transmitter 
duplex 
distributor, 
front 
axle 
proportional 
relay 
valve, 
front 
axle 
ABS 
valve, 
axle 
electrical 
and 
compressed 
air 
modulator 
and 
trailer 
control 
servo 
distributor. 


The 
EBS 
system 
dialogs 
with 
the 
centers 
of 
the 
other 
units: 
Engine, 
Ecas, 
transmission 
decelerator 
via 
the 
CAN 
line 
(VDB 
Vehicle 
Data 
Bus). 


Advantages 
of 
the 
EBS 


Reduced 
maintenance 
costs. 


The 
EBS 
combines 
several 
different 
functions, 
the 
objective 
being 
to 
minimize 
maintenance 
costs 
at 
maximized 
braking 
safety 
and 
minimizing 
brake 
pad 
wear. 


Individual 
controls 
to 
front 
and 
rear 
axle 
pad 
wear 
parameters 
harmonize 
pad 
wear 
and 
homogeneous 
load 
distribution 
to 
all 
wheel 
brakes 
minimizes 
overall 
consumption. 
Additionally, 
maintenance 
intervals 
and 
pad 
replacement 
also 
coincide. 
This 
dramatically 
reduces 
downtime 
costs. 


Owners 
can 
achieve 
substantial 
savings 
according 
to 
maintenance 
required 
for 
a 
motor 
vehicle 
and 
other 
factors. 
Comparison 
of 
brake 
system 
maintenance 
costs 
for 
a 
vehicle 
with 
EBS 
and 
one 
with 
a 
conventional 
braking 
system 
underscores 
great 
cost 
cutting. 


Tractor 
and 
Trailer 
Compatibility 
at 
all 
times 


Especially 
when 
changed 
frequently 
often 
with 
conventional 
systems, 
harmonizing 
the 
braking 
processes 
of 
the 
entire 
tractor 
and 
trailer 
combination 
is 
unsatisfactory. 


Inadequate 
balance, 
such 
as 
a 
trailer 
with 
scant 
braking 
efficiency, 
causes 
unequal 
brake 
pad 
wear. 


The 
EBS 
identifies 
all 
tractor 
and 
trailer 
incompatibility 
and 
automatically 
harmonizes 
braking. 
Brake 
maintenance 
costs 
are 
not 
only 
optimized 
but 
safety 
and 
comfort 
are 
also 
maximized 
when 
brakes 
operate 
in 
the 
best 
possible 
conditions. 


Complete 
Diagnostic 
Structures 


The 
EBS 
offers 
vehicles 
owners 
constantly 
updated 
information 
on 
braking 
system 
and 
basic 
brake 
component 
conditions. 
This 
enables 
prior 
organization 
of 
maintenance 
periods. 
The 
EBS 
monitors 
all 
braking 
system 
functions 
and 
basic 
components. 
All 
defects 
identified 
by 
the 
system 
are 
carefully 
displayed, 
so 
maintenance 
specialists 
can 
readily 
correct 
them. 
The 
high 
degree 
of 
safety 
the 
EBS 
guarantees 
is 
due 
to 
several 
factors, 
as 
follows: 
-Reduced 
front 
and 
rear 
tractor 
and 
trailer 
axle 
response 
and 
pressure 
accumulation 
times. 
-Improved 
ABS 
function. 
-Tractor 
and 
trailer 
balanced 
at 
all 
times. 
-Constant 
service 
braking 
system 
monitoring. 
The 
EBS 
warns 
the 
operator 
of 
reduced 
brake 
efficiency. 
-The 
integrated 
ASR 
function 
enables 
optimum 
motor 
vehicle 
stability 
and 
optimized 
traction.

The 
ABS 
ó 
EBL 
braking 
system 
is 
available 
as 
an 
alternative 
to 
the 
EBS 
system 
on 
4x2 
e 
6x2 
vehicles. 


ABS 
Anti 
ó 
Lock 
Brake 
System 


Braking 
a 
moving 
vehicle 
and 
is 
deceleration 
and 
stopping 
distance 
are 
essentially 
dependant 
on 
adherence 
between 
tire 
and 
road 
surface. 
Improved 
braking 
with 
an 
efficient 
braking 
system 
can 
only 
be 
achieved 
by 
acting 
on 
tire 
friction 
features 
or 
road 
surface 
quality. 


Even 
in 
optimum 
conditions, 
absolutely 
safe 
braking 
is 
not 
guaranteed 
when 
critical 
situations 
have 
to 
be 
coped 
with, 
such 
as 
low 
adherence 
due 
on 
a 
wet 
or 
iced 
road 
surface, 
which 
obliges 
the 
vehicle 
operator 
to 
moderate 
braking 
action 
to 
prevent 
possible 
wheel 
locks 
and 
consequent 
dangerous 
loss 
of 
vehicle 
control. 


The 
ABS 
therefore 
has 
the 
function 
of 
ensuring 
vehicle 
stability 
in 
any 
braking 
condition 
by 
preventing 
wheel 
locks 
independently 
of 
road 
surface 
conditions 
and 
guarantee 
full 
exploitation 
of 
available 
adherence. 


The 
system 
enables 
maintaining 
direction 
control 
even 
in 
emergency 
braking 
and 
acting 
on 
the 
steering 
wheel 
to 
avoid 
obstacles 
with 
danger 
of 
vehicle 
control 
loss. 


In 
essence, 
the 
ABS 
system: 


-prevents 
wheel 
locks 
during 
vehicle 
braking 
in 
and 
road 
adherence 
conditions 


-reduces 
stop 
distances 


-offers 
operator 
safety 
for 
stability 
and 
vehicle 
control 
maintenance. 


Electronic 
Brakes 
Limiter 
EBL 


The 
EBL 
function 
controls 
rear 
axle 
wheel 
skidding 
by 
comparing 
it 
with 
front 
wheel 
speed. 
Data 
entering 
the 
center 
are 
wheel 
rpm 
and 
braking 
pressure 
measured 
by 
the 
pressure 
sensor 
installed 
upstream 
the 
rear 
axle 
ABS 
modulators. 
The 
center 
uses 
these 
data 
to 
calculate 
vehicle 
speed 
and 
deceleration, 
rear 
axle 
wheel 
skid 
and 
minimum 
deceleration 
required. 
The 
EBL 
function 
is 
activated 
with 
rear 
ABS 
modulators 
maintaining 
set 
pressure 
when 
the 
operators 
applies 
excess 
braking 
force 
than 
required 
for 
vehicle 
load 
conditions, 
in 
essence 
when 
vehicle 
deceleration 
and 
rear 
axle 
skid 
thresholds 
are 
passed.

The 
objective 
of 
the 
electronic 
center 
is 
to 
slow 
down 
the 
vehicle 
as 
fast 
as 
possible, 
guarantee 
its 
stability 
and 
avoid 
the 
tendency 
to 
lock 
wheels. 
When 
braking, 
the 
center 
is 
informed 
of 
the 
following 
to 
reach 
these 
objectives: 
-braking 
intensity 
required 
by 
the 
operator 
via 
the 
rear 
axle 
pressure 
sensor 


-slowing 
reaction 
due 
to 
pressures 
made 
available 
via 
signals 
from 
the 
speed 
sensors. 
Ongoing 
monitoring 
and 
processing 
of 
these 
data 
referred 
to 
the 
objective 
set 
required 
activation 
of 
rear

This non self-limited coaxial component consists of an electrical and a compressed air section, the former consisting pf twoswitches 
and two position sensors generating the braking signals the center needs to manage the system. 
These signals are redundant to guarantee top reliability. 
The compressed air section distributes pressure to the front axle braking circuit and to the trailer control servo distributor. 
These pressures are always available but are mostly used in case of electrical/electronic system breakdown.

Sensors 
continuously 
supply 
the 
electronic 
center 
with 
all 
the 
data 
it 
requires 
to 
properly 
pilot 
the 
electro 
valves. 


Signals 
are 
obtained 
from 
magnetic 
flow 
lines 
that 
close 
through 
the 
teeth 
of 
a 
teethed 
wheel 
facing 
the 
sensor 
and 
rotating 
together 
with 
the 
wheel. 
Passage 
from 
full 
to 
empty 
due 
to 
the 
presence 
or 
absence 
of 
the 
tooth 
causes 
sufficient 
magnetic 
flow 
variation 
to 
create 
induced 


electromagnetic 
force 
at 
sensor 
terminals 
and 
thus 
an 
alternating 
electrical 
signal 
that 
is 
sent 
to 
the 
electronic 
center. 


The 
clearance 
between 
the 
sensor 
and 
wheel, 
called 
air 
gap, 
must 
obviously 
be 
at 
a 
pre-set 
value 
of 
0.8 
˜ 
1.6 
mm 
for 
proper 
signals 
to 
be 
sent. 
Resistance 
of 
each 
sensor 
at 
connection 
terminals 
is 
between 
1 
and 
2 
kW. 
The 
toothed 
wheel 
is 
called 
sound 
wheel 
because 
the 
signal 
it 
generates 
has 
the 
same 
frequency 
as 
a 
sound 
wave. 
The 
frequency 
of 
this 
signal 
serves 
to 
define 
wheel 
rotation 
speed. 
Frequency 
variations, 
or 
the 
speed 
at 
which 
signals 
follow 
one 
another, 
define 
acceleration 
and 
deceleration 
rates.

connected 
system 
safety 
devices. 
The 
ECAS 
electronic 
provides 
automatic 
frame 
ground 
clearance 
control 
via 
the 
real 
values 
supplied 
by 
the 
sensors, 
which 
are 
compared 
with 
stored 
rated 
data. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
setting 
deviations 
or 
variations, 
the 
electronic 
center 
pilots 
the 
electro-pneumatic 
units 
through 
which 
it 
corrects 
real 
levels 
versus 
those 
stored 
previously 
by 
the 
operator. 


The 
system 
is 
provided 
with 
remote 
control 
for 
frame 
lifting/lowering 
and 
leveling 
and 
operations 
are 
possible 
both 
with 
the 
vehicle 
stationary 
and 
moving. 


This 
unit 
also 
enables 
other 
frame 
setting 
level 
storage 
and 
retrieval 
when 
required 
by 
operating 
conditions. 
Vehicle 
lifting, 
lowering 
and 
leveling 
before 
load 
and 
unload 
operations 
are 
via 
the 
remote 
control 
located 
on 
the 
operator 
seat 
side. 


The 
remote 
control 
can 
be 
extracted 
from 
its 
support 
so 
these 
operations 
can 
also 
be 
performed 
from 
ground 
level. 
When 
unloading 
heavy 
loads 
or 
containers 
with 
a 
crane, 
the 
frame 
can 
be 
lowered 
completely. 
Do 
no 
stop 
the 
engine 
when 
warning 
light 
(10) 
goes 
on. 


If 
warning 
light 
(9) 
goes 
on 
when 
the 
vehicle 
moves, 
stop 
the 
vehicle 
and 
turn 
the 
ignition 
key 
to 
STOP; 
return 
it 
to 
MAR 
after 
about 
7 
seconds. 
Contact 
the 
Service 
Network 
if 
warning 
light 
(9) 
does 
not 
go 
off 
after 
some 
two 
seconds.

Description 


Automated 
EuroTronic 
is 
a 
completely 
automatic 
transmission 
featuring 
a 
regulated 
dry 
clutch 
that 
eliminates 
the 
clutch 
pedal. 
It 
consists 
of 
a 
reduced 
noise 
emission 
main 
gearbox 
with 
a 
planetary 
and 
split 
group. 
The 
main 
unit 
meshes 
with 
front 
teeth 
and 
only 
the 
planetary 
and 
split 
group 
are 
synchronized. 
The 
16-speed 
Automated 
EuroTronic 
features 
sixteen 
forward 
and 
two 
reverse 
speeds. 
The 
Instrument 
cluster 
supplied 
the 
operator 
with 
all 
necessary 
system 
information, 
such 
as 
gear 
meshed, 
disturbances 
and 
the 


like. 
The 
insert 
module 
and 
the 
clutch 
regulator 
unit 
are 
the 
most 
important 
structural 
elements 
for 
complete 
transmission 
automation. 
The 
former 
consists 
of 
the 
transmission 
electronic 
system, 
switching 
valves, 
cylinder 
and 
sensors. 
The 
transmission 
electronic 
system 
processes 
all 
input 
signals 
and 
inserts 
the 
speed 
via 
the 
electromagnetic 
valve 
and 
the 
switching 


cylinder. 


The 
clutch 
regulator 
is 
set 
electro-pneumatically 
and 
performs 
all 
friction 
actuation 
operations. 
In 
the 
manual 
mode, 
the 
operator 
can 
easily 
select 
speeds 
with 
the 
speed 
selector 
lever. 
In 
the 
automatic 
mode, 
the 
operator 
only 
has 
to 
actuate 
the 
accelerator 
or 
brake 
pedal. 
Speeds 
are 
selected 
automatically 
by 
the 
system. 
To 
respect 
anti-pollution 
regulations, 
all 
gears 
are 
helical 
teeth, 
which 
enabled 
abating 
noise 
level 
about 
79 
db.

Keep 
the

5 
seconds. 
The 
operator 
can 
select 
the 
speed 
at 
which 
to 
start 
with 
gearshift 
lever, 
and 
can 
select 
as 
many 
as 
7 
speeds 
forward 
and 
2 
reverse 
with 
the 
16 
speed 
transmissions 
and 
5 
and 
2 
respectively 
with 
the 
12-speed 
one. 
Selection 
is 
managed 
by 
the 
system 
via 
an 
internal 
delay 
reaction 
time 
and 
not 
through 
the 
speed 
with 
which 
the 
gearshift 
lever 
sensors 
identify 
lever 
movements. 
Speed 
selection 
must 
be 
slow 
to 
allow 
the 
system 
to 
implement 
each 
individual 
speed, 
as 
the 
Cluster 
displays 
individual 
speeds 
with 
a 
delay 
of 
a 
few 
seconds. 
The 
speeds 
that 
can 
be 
set 
with 
the 
Limp 
Home 
function 
can 
only 
be 
selected 
with 
the 
vehicle 
stationary. 
After 
start 
speed 
selection, 
pressing 
the 
function 
push 
button 
for 
at 
least 
2 
seconds 
makes 
the 
system 
control 
timed 
clutch 
engagement. 
To 
prevent 
the 
engine 
from 
stopping, 
the 
clutch 
disengages 
automatically 
when 
the 
speed 
output 
from 
the 
transmission 
is 
below 
a 
reference 
threshold. 
Is 
the 
clutch 
sensor 
is 
not 
operating 
properly, 
the 
clutch 
can 
only 
be 
engaged/disengaged 
manually 
with 
the 
Function 
push 
button. 
The 
system 
disregards 
any 
gearshift 
lever 
movement 
during 
vehicle 
movement. 
In 
particular, 
push 
button 
function 
operation 
is 
excluded 
when 
engine 
rpm 
is 
over 
950 
and 
reactivated 
at 
under 
this 
rating. 
Clutch 
management 
can 
thus 
also 
be 
manual 
with 
the 
function 
push 
button 
on 
the 
gearshift 
lever 
of 
the 
brake 
pedal 
when 
engine 
rpm 
is 
under/equal 
to 
950. 
When 
the 
vehicle 
is 
stopped 
with 
the 
Limp 
Home 
function, 
the 
clutch 
is 
managed 
automatically 
if 
possible 
or 
manually 
as 
described 
above. 
At 
vehicle 
stop, 
the 
system 
keeps 
the 
Limp 
Home 
function 
active 
with 
the 
start 
speed 
set 
previously

ELECTRONIC CENTER 
It is integrated into the gearshift actuator. 
Automatic transmission management enables automating speed selection andmeshing with automatic clutch and engine control. 
It interfaces with the other on-board electronic systems such as the EDC, EBS, INTARDER and Instrument Cluster via a CAN 
V.D.B. Vehicle Data Bus line. 
From connection with the EDC system the transmission electronic center can detect accelerator pedal position, fuel delivery, 
engine rpm and engine brake and kick-down activation. 
The center inside houses center temperature, transmission oil temperature and low air pressure sensors to improve system 
operation. 
Function AL is enabled at <5.8 bar pressure and disabled at> 6 bars. The Automated EuroTronic transmission electronic center 
offers the possibility of aCluster displayed error code for preliminary diagnosis and is also provided with an advanced self-diagnosis 
system capable of identifying and storing any even intermittent anomaly dependent on environmental condition the system may 
have encountered during operation, to ensure more correct and reliable repair.

INTARDER 
Operation 


The 
intarder 
is 
operated 
with 
the 
7-position 
sector 
located 
in 
the 
right 
direction 
indicator 
(1). 
INTARDER 
cut-in 
indication 
is 
managed 
by 
the 
CLUSTER 
(2) 
via 
a 
specific 
warning. 


The 
system 
is 
provided 
with 
a 
Brensomat 
constant 
velocity 
function 
used 
for 
vehicles 
without 
EBS. 
This 
function 
enables 
keeping 
a 
vehicle 
on 
a 
downhill 
slop 
moving 
at 
the 
speed 
as 
selected 
by 
the 
operator. 
In 
this 
case, 
the 
intarder 
electronic 
centre 
automatically 
selects 
the 
braking 
torque 
required. 


The 
constant 
velocity 
function 
is 
only 
activated 
in 
position 
ì0î 
after 
storing 
the 
speed 
desired. 


Storage 
can 
be 
at 
any 
of 
the 
7 
selector 
positions 
by 
briefly 
pressing 
the 
push 
button 
provided; 
with 
higher 
pressure 
storing 
speed 
at 
that 
moment 
and 
lower 
pressure 
decrease 
of 
speed 
set. 
The 
speed 
programmed 
previously 
is 
restored 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
selector 
is 
returned 
to 
position 
ì0î. 


Pressing 
the 
push 
button 
once 
again 
disenables 
the 
constant 
velocity 
function. 
The 
oil 
contained 
in 
the 
sump 
is 
sent 
to 
the 
intarder 
hydraulic 
circuit 
via 
a 
filter 
and 
the 
circuit 
is 
protected 
by 
a 
safety 
valve. 


By 
acting 
on 
selector 
(1), 
electronic 
centre 
(4) 
receives 
via 
SWI 
(3) 
an 
electrical 
signal 
that 
it 
processes 
and 
sends 
to 
electro 
valve 
(7) 
controlling 
the 
accumulator 
and 
proportional 
electro 
valve 
(5). 


The 
accumulator 
control 
electro 
valve 
switches 
and 
lets 
air 
under 
pressure 
pass 
through 
its 
piston 
to 
send 
oil 
to 
the 
hydraulic 
circuit 
and 
reduce 
action 
time. 


The 
proportional 
electro 
valve 
acts 
on 
the 
control 
valve 
to 
set 
its 
pressure. 
The 
adjustment 
valve 
is 
piloted 
by 
control 
valve 
oil 
pressure. 
The 
rotor 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
rear 
axle 
via 
the 
transmission 
shaft 
and 
the 
stator 
is 
connected 
to 
the 
frame 
through 
the 
intarder 
case. 


The 
oil 
contained 
in 
the 
areas 
between 
the 
rotor 
and 
the 
stator 
is 
moved 
by 
the 
rotor 
blades 
to 
create 
a 
closed 
circuit 
oil 
flow 
between 
mobile 
and 
fixed 
parts. 


By 
impacting 
the 
stator 
blades, 
oil 
causes 
rotor 
and 
therefore 
vehicle 
braking. 
Reduced 
oil 
flow 
speed 
between 
the 
rotor 
and 
the 
stator 
transforms 
kinetic 
energy 
into 
heat, 
to 
dissipate 
which 
oil 
passes 
through 
an 
oil/water 
heat 
exchanger, 
where 
oil 
heat 
is 
transmitted 
to 
cooling 
water 
and 
dissipated 
through 
the 
vehicle 
cooling 
system. 


The 
heat 
exchanger 
water 
discharge 
pipe 
is 
provided 
with 
a 
temperature 
sensor 
(6) 
that 
continually 
sends 
cooling 
water 
temperature 
data 
to 
the 
electronic 
centre 
to 
ensure 
maximum 
temperature 
allowed 
for 
proper 
engine 
operation 
is 
not 
exceeded. 
If 
water 
temperature 
rises 
to 
reach 
the 
safety 
limit 
for 
any 
reason 
whatsoever, 
the 
centre 
pilots 
sump 
control 
air 
adjustment 
to 
reduce 
braking 
torque. 
The 
electronic 
centre 
receives 
a 
signal 
from 
the 
ABS/EBS 
system 
that 
causes 
intarder 
cutout 
when 
actuated 
and 
it 
also 
receives 
a 
signal 
from 
electronic 
tachograph 
(8) 
enabling 
constant 
velocity 
function 
use. 
This 
signal 
is 
sent 
via 
a 
VDB 
can 
line. 


Switching 
to 
position 
ì0î 
cuts 
the 
intarder 
off 
and 
deactivates 
the 
proportional 
and 
accumulator 
control 
electro 
valves.

Hydraulic system diagram 
Description 
The oil contained in the sump is sent to the intarder hydraulic circuit by a pump through a filter and a 12.5 bar pressure 
limiter valve. 
Intarder on 
When the intarder is actuated with control (2), the centre supplies electro valve (19) controlling accumulator (10), 
whose piston is piloted by the service air system at 9.5 bar pressure to send oil faster to the rotor/stator unit. 
When excited, proportional electro valve (16) acts on valve (16) by moving its hydraulic spool and moves function 
control pressure to braking level. 
Pressure acts on adjustment valve (14), to create communication between input duct P and output ducts P 1 - R. 
Thus, oil from pressure limiter electro valve (4) moves the hydraulic spool of valve (8) and puts duct R01 0into communication 
with the motor/stator via heat exchanger (9). 
Pressure (13) is not affected by oil pressure and closes oil discharge into sump (7).
